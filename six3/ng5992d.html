  <B>SIX???/612  Invalid Key Length</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>The stored index key length and actual length when evaluating
             the key expression were found to be different.

  <B>Solution:  </B>Make sure the key expression will produce a value of the same
             length for all records.  Do not use functions such as TRIM() in
             the key expression.  To restrict the length of the key values,
             use the LEFT() or PADR() functions.  If a User-Defined Function
             (UDF) is used in the key expression, make sure that the same
             function is available in all applications that use the index,
             and that the function returns a value of the same length for all
             records.

             This error can also come up if the index command is using ext-
             ended expressions without using the proper header file.  To use
             extended expressions, you must use the SIXCDX2.CH or SIXNSX2.CH
             file instead of SIXCDX.CH or SIXNSX.CH.
