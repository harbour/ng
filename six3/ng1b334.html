  <B>OrdListAdd():</B>

  Syntax:   OrdListAdd( &lt;cIndexFile&gt; [, &lt;cOrderName&gt;] )

       cIndexFile = The name of the index file containing one or more Orders.
                    You may specify &lt;cIndexFile&gt; as the filename with or
                    without the path name or extension.  If you do not inc-
                    lude the extension as part of &lt;cIndexFile&gt;, the default
                    extension of the currently active RDD is assumed.

       cOrderName = The name of the specific Order from the Order Bag to be
                    added to the Order List of the current work area.  If you
                    do not specify &lt;cOrderName&gt;, all orders in the Order Bag
                    are added to the Order List of the current work area.

  Returns:  NIL

  Description:

     OrdListAdd() is an Order management function that adds the contents of
     an Order Bag , or a single Order in an Order Bag, to the Order List.
     This function lets you extend the Order List without issuing a SET INDEX
     command that, first, clears all the active Orders from the Order List.

     Any Orders already associated with the work area continue to be active.
     If the newly opened Order Bag contains the only Order associated with
     the work area, it becomes the controlling Order; otherwise, the
     controlling Order remains unchanged.

     After the new Orders are opened, the work area is positioned to the
     first logical record in the controlling Order.

     OrdListAdd() is similar to the SET INDEX command or the INDEX clause of
     the USE command, except that it does not clear the Order List prior to
     adding the new order(s).

     OrdListAdd() supersedes the dbSetIndex() function.

     The active RDD determines the Order capacity of an Order Bag.  The
     default  DBFNTX and the DBFNDX drivers (and the SIx Driver's SIXNTX
     flavor) only support single-Order Bags, while other RDDs may support
     multiple-Order Bags (e.g., the SIXCDX and SIXNSX drivers).  When using
     RDDs that support multiple Order Bags, you must explicitly SET ORDER
     (or OrdSetFocus()) to the desired controlling Order.  If you do not
     specify a controlling Order, the data file will be viewed in natural
     Order.

 Example:

     // Assume TEST.CDX contains three orders (or tags): LAST, STATE, and AGE
     // OrdListAdd() opens TEST.CDX but only uses the order named STATE:

     USE test VIA "SIXCDX"
     <B>OrdListAdd( "TEST", "STATE" )</B>
