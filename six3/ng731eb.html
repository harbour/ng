  <B>Specific Situations:</B>

  The power of the HiPer-SEEK text searching system stems from its inherent
  flexibility. HiPer-SEEK creates a searchable index from strings of text.
  The source of the input strings, and how they are formed is entirely
  under the control of the application programmer. Unlike Clipper's native
  indexing function, HiPer-SEEK indexes are not tightly bound to Clipper's
  basic data types, nor does HiPer-SEEK know anything about how Clipper
  stores data.

  At first, this might be seen as a hindrance to rapid program development,
  but when you combine HiPer-SEEK with Clipper's powerful built-in string
  manipulation features it is, in fact, quite easy to put HiPer-SEEK to
  work to accomplish tasks with Clipper that otherwise would be difficult
  or impossible. Tasks like searching memo fields, searching multiple
  fixed-length fields with one call, and searching across related .DBFs are
  easy to implement using HiPer-SEEK.
