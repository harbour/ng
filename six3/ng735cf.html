  <B>Searching for Embedded Text and Text Fragments:</B>

  HiPer-SEEK has no difficulty finding instances of embedded text. In pure
  Clipper, you might use a technique like this:

    <B>DO WHILE !eof()              </B>
    <B>  IF &lt;search text&gt; $ field1  </B>
    <B>    ? "Got one!"             </B>
    <B>  ENDIF                      </B>
    <B>  SKIP                       </B>
    <B>ENDDO                        </B>

  While this method will work, it forces you, just as LOCATE does, to
  search sequentially through your file(s) to find instances of the search
  text.  Clipper's native indexes are of no use in situations like this,
  since all matches using SEEK require that valid finds match from the
  beginning of the indexed string.

  With a HiPer-SEEK index in place, you already have the ability to search
  for embedded strings. HiPer-SEEK's indexing mechanism will return all
  valid hits for a given search string, regardless of where that string
  falls within the index's records.
