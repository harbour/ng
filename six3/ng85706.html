  <B>What is query optimization?:</B>

  Query optimization is the process of finding the best way to find a set
  of records in a database meeting a search criteria.   Mach SIx optimizes
  queries by first searching the index files, for every index key expression
  found in the FOR condition of a query.   This step produces a set of
  records, in most cases, many times smaller than the original table to
  visit and test the remaining non-indexed portion of the query.  Fully
  indexed queries, in some cases, can be satisfied directly from the index
  files.  The result, is maximum query efficiency and throughput when
  targeting a subset of data in a large database file.
