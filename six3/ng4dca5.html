  <B>SET DELETED ON|OFF:</B>

  The SIx Driver (and the Mach SIx query optimizer) support the SET DELETED
  command in the exact same way as in native Clipper, with one exception.

  Normally if SET DELETED is ON, Mach SIx is forced to visit all the records
  found in the indexes to test their deletion status.  However, you can
  eliminate this requirement by simply maintaining an index or tag on
  <B>DELETED()</B> for the database files you will frequently query.

  This way, COUNTs with SET DELETED ON can truly be 100% optimizable!  Not
  only will COUNTS execute faster, but other commands as well, especially
  for databases with a large number of deleted records.
