  <B>Why am I getting four Unresolved External errors (__ZCMP, etc...)</B>
  <B>when I link?:</B>

  If you are using the International SIx 3.0 release, you must link in one
  of the included nation modules to select the index sorting table for the
  language you are using.

  For example, to use the American/English sorting order, you'd use the
  SIXUK.OBJ file:

    <B>BLINKER FI test,</B> <U>sixuk</U> <B>@six3</B>

  These .OBJ files can be found in the directory where all of your other
  SIx Driver .OBJ files were installed.  Unless you specified a different
  directory during installation, this would be \SIX3\OBJ.


    <B>NOTE:  These foreign nation modules are only included, and required,</B>
    <B>       with the International SIx 3.0 release.  See the</B> <U>"Notes For</U>
    <B>       <U>International Users ONLY"</U> </B>section earlier in this documentation<B></B>
    <B>       for more details on how to use these foreign nation modules.</B>
