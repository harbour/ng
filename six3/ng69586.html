  <B>Data Dictionary (.INI) Support:</B>

  Each database in your application can have an associated .INI file, which
  will provide various information to the Trigger System on how that
  particular database should be opened.  These files can also hold
  information, in user-defined sections, which can be read from the .INI
  file into an array by using Sx_INIheader().

  An .INI file is just a plain ASCII text file that the developer would
  create with their text editor.  The file must have the same base name as
  its associated database file.  For example, TEST.INI would belong to
  TEST.DBF, FOO.INI to FOO.DBF, and so on.

  <U>NOTE:  See the INIDEMO.PRG sample program for an example of using the</U>
  <U>       Data Dictionary (.INI) System.</U>
