  <B>Sx_IsMyROX():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_IsMyROX()

  Returns:  .T. if a Read-Only lock has been set on the currently active
            index (<U>using the Sx_ROXLock() function</U>) by you (meaning the
            network workstation that is calling this function at the time);
            .F. if not.

  Description:  This function is used to test if the currently active index
                has a Read-Only lock active on it that this work station
                activated.  The only network user who can unlock the index
                lock is the one who set it.  This function can't tell you
                <B>who</B> locked the index, but it can tell you if it was the
                user calling this function at the time.

    NOTE:  This function is NOT supported under SIXNTX.

  Example:

    // This code snippet demonstrates a simple test that can be used to
    // verify that you haven't left a Read-Only Lock active on an index.

    IF Sx_IsROXLock()              // Is Read-Only Index Locking Active?
      IF <B>Sx_IsMYROX()</B>              // If so, did this user lock the index?
        Sx_ROXUnLock()             // If so, unlock the index
      ELSE
        Alert("Index was locked by another user!")  // Display message
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
