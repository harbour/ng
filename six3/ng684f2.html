  <B>FPT/SMT memo files reuse discarded blocks:</B>

  Unlike Clipper or FoxPRO, the SIx Driver keeps a "free block" list in the
  header of its FPT/SMT memo files, which lets it know which blocks within
  the file have been freed.  Blocks can be freed up either by simply deleting
  the associcated record in the DBF file, or by adding enough data to the
  memo that makes it require more blocks than it's already using.

  For example, with Clipper's DBT memo files, if you have just the word
  "Bogus" stored in a memo field, that tiny little five byte word is taking
  up <B>512 bytes</B>!  That's the block size used by Clipper's DBT files.  Now,
  if you delete that record, those 512 bytes do <B>not</B> get deleted from the
  memo file, even if you do a PACK.<B>  Also, if you add another 600 characters</B>
  to that memo field, they no longer fit into that one block.  Unless you're
  lucky, and that was the last block in the memo file, Clipper abandons that
  block, and moves all 605 of those new bytes to two <B>new</B> 512 byte blocks at
  the bottom of the memo file.  Now that old 512 byte block is laying around
  making your DBT file fatter than it was before.

  Well...not only do the SIx Driver's FPT/SMT memo files use default block
  sizes of 32 and 1 (respectively) to reduce excess memo bloat, but it also
  will automatically check the "free block list" in the memo file header
  for an abandoned block to reuse before adding a new one to the bottom of
  the memo file.  Cool, eh?

  And, if you happen to free up more blocks at one time than the SIx Driver
  can keep track of in the header (about 80 or so), we have even provided
  you with the handy <B>MEMOPACK</B> command or the <B>Sx_MemoPack()</B> function.
  These work on DBT memo files as well as on FPT and SMT memo files.
