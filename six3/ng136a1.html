  <B>m6_FreeFilter():</B>

  Purpose:  Releases all memory associated with a Roll-Your-Own filter.

   Syntax:  m6_FreeFilter( &lt;nHandle&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;nHandle&gt;     --  Is a handle to a previously allocated
                              RYO filter.

  Returns:  Logical value:  .T. means the operation was successful,  .F.
            indicates it failed.  In the case of a .F. value call m6_Error()
            to retrieve the reason for the error.

     Note:  You must own the filter in order to free it.  For details
            on filter ownership seek the section on RYO filters.

            Remember, if you set an RYO filter that you created to the current
            workarea via m6_SetAreaFilter() you transfer ownership to the
            system, and it is no longer your responsibility to free it.

            *Always free RYO filters that are no longer being used.*

  Example:

         #include "SIXCDX.CH"
         #include "MACHSIX.CH"

         //.............................................use customer file
         USE Customer via "SIXCDX"

         //.............................................create RYO filter
         nHandle := m6_NewFilter( "State='CA'" )

         ? 'No. of records where STATE="CA" ='
         ?? m6_FiltCount( nHandle )

         //...............................free memory allocated to filter
         <B>m6_FreeFilter( nHandle )</B>
