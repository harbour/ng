  <B>Sx_Decrypt():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_Decrypt( &lt;cString&gt; [, cKeyVal] )

        cString = String of data to be decrypted.  The string of data is
                  decrypted using the 64-bit password previously set by
                  Sx_SetPass().

        cKeyVal = Optional password code to use for decrypting the encrypted
                  string.  If no password value is passed, the value set by
                  the Sx_SetPass() function (or the USE...PASSWORD command)
                  for the current workarea is used.

  Returns:  A string containing the data decrypted from cString.  If the
            value passed to Sx_Decrypt is not a character string, that same
            value (unchanged) is returned.

  Description:  Sx_Decrypt() and it related function Sx_Encrypt() provide
                an easy way to integrate data security to a system.  The
                encryption engine provides security through the use of a
                64-bit (8 byte) security code and multi-adaptive computa-
                tion.  Multi-adaptive computation ensures a wide uniqueness
                within the outputted encrypted string.  If a string of all
                blanks were encrypted you would see a wide distribution of
                characters.  This ensures a reasonable amount of security
                at a small speed penalty.

                Of course, the best way to protect your data is to keep it
                away from those who shouldn't have access to it.  Protect
                your passwords, and don't store them in .DBF files.

                This encryption/decryption method is _not_ DES (Data
                Encryption Standard) compliant so it can be used in
                programs distributed both in the US and Overseas.

  Example:

    // Display encrypted field data, provided data was previously encrypted
    // using the same password.  Otherwise, data will be unreadable.

    LOCAL cPassWord := Space(8), cTemp := ""

    USE secret VIA "SIXCDX"   // Open SECRET.DBF
    dbGoTop()                 // Make sure we're at the top

    Scroll()
    @ 0, 0 SAY "Enter Password:" GET cPassWord
    READ

    @ 2, 0 SAY "Code Name: " + <B>Sx_Decrypt( secret-&gt;CODENAME, cPassWord )</B>
