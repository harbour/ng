  <B>hs_Create():</B>

  Purpose:  Used to create a new, empty HiPer-SEEK index file. If another
            file of the same name exists, it will be over written.  Unlike
            hs_Index(), this function does not automatically populate the
            HiPer-SEEK index file.

   Syntax:  hs_Create( &lt;cExpr&gt;,&lt;nBufSize&gt;,&lt;nKeySize&gt;,&lt;lCase&gt;,&lt;nFiltSet&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;cExpr&gt; is a string representing a file path name. It may contain
              drive and subdirectory information.

            &lt;nBufSize&gt; an integer that will be multiplied by 1024 to
              determine how much buffer space is to be used by the HiPer-SEEK
              routines for this index. For example, a value of 10 will
              allocate 10k or 10240 bytes of buffer space plus a small amount
              of overhead. This is sometimes referred to as BUFFER SIZE.

            &lt;nKeySize&gt; is an integer from 1 to 3. This value has two effects:

              1)  The larger the value, the greater the number of bytes
                  written for each record in the index.

              2)  The larger the value the lower the number of aliases (or
                  false positives) returned by a search.

              For most cases, a value of 2 is the best choice, offering a
              low alias rate and small index size. For a value of two, each
              new index record increases the size of the index by 32 bytes.
              For values of 1 and 3 it increases by 16 and 64 bytes
              respectively. Sometimes referred to as INDEX SIZE or SIZE
              FACTOR, it is usually worthwhile to do some experimentation.

           &lt;lCase&gt; can be set to either .T. or .F., depending if case is to
              be significant during matches. If .T., then case is not signi-
              ficant and lower-case will match both lower and upper-case. If
              the value is .F., then upper-case characters will not match
              lower-case.

           &lt;nFiltSet&gt; is a number which indicates the filter set to be used
              for indexing and searching.  A filter set is a translation of
              characters from the source to the index. HiPer-SEEK indexes
              have two sets.

              Filter set 1, the recommended choice, will mask off the high-
              order bit and treat all non-printing characters as spaces.
              Filter set 2 does not eliminate any characters. For most text
              purposes, filter set 1 is recommended since it eliminates
              carriage returns, line-feeds, etc., from becoming part of the
              index.

              Filter set 2 is useful for non-standard character sets which
              use the high order bit.

  Returns:  If successful, a non-negative integer, representing the
            HiPer-SEEK index file handle.  Otherwise, returns a negative
            integer indicating an error.  Valid handles range from 0 to 63.
            See comment 5 below.

  Errors Returned:

      -1 (CREATEFAIL) System was unable to create the file specified.
         Check that you are not trying to write over a protected file and
         that there is sufficient space on disk for the file.
      -2 (MEMERR) System was unable to allocate the memory requested. Try
         again with a smaller value of &lt;nVal&gt;.
      -3 (BADWRITE) System generated a write error while writing the index
         file header.
     -16 (BADPARMS) Invalid parameters were passed to the function.

  Comments:

    1.  &lt;lCase&gt; is set during the index creation process and cannot be
    changed later. Appreciable time savings in execution speed are realized
    when case is not significant (i.e. &lt;lCase &gt; is .T.).

    2.  Unlike &lt;lCase&gt;, &lt;nBufSize&gt; can be different each time the file is
    opened. &lt;nBufSize&gt; only specifies the amount of memory buffer used, and
    is not otherwise an indexing factor. This is why &lt;nVal1&gt; is an argument
    for both hs_Create() and hs_Open() while &lt;lCase&gt; is not.

    Generally, the larger this buffer is the faster an index file will be
    created. The buffer size is less important to performance in systems
    using fast fixed disks and disk caching. The index file can be opened
    later with a smaller buffer. The memory used for these buffers is
    released when the index file is closed.

    3.  The value of &lt;nKeySize&gt; relates to the speed of index creation
    and retrieval. For a value of 2, each record occupies 32 bytes in
    memory. If the total number of records indexed * 32 is less than the
    value of &lt;nKeySize&gt; * 1024, then the entire index can be buffered
    in memory, greatly increasing the speed of adds and finds. Otherwise
    disk accesses will be needed for each find and add. This value can be
    used to check if the correct number of records are in an index file.

      Example: (100 records * 32) + 512 (the header) == 3712 bytes.

    4.  hs_Create() creates an index file with no records in it. You must
    add records using hs_Add(). hs_Create() leaves this index file open so
    don't try to open it again without closing it first. It is a good idea
    to close a newly created file and then reopen it before searching. This
    allows you to change the buffer size and the network mode of the index
    file. Using hs_Index() instead will eliminate many of the potential
    problems encountered in creating a new index file.

    5.  The hs_Create(), hs_Index(), and hs_Open() functions return a
    'HANDLE' to the calling program. This handle is an integer between 0 and
    63.  You must save the handle returned by these functions for use with
    the remaining HiPer-SEEK functions. HiPer-SEEK handles are nothing more
    than an identifier returned by HiPer-SEEK's create and open routines; in
    other words, the value of a HiPer-SEEK handle is only meaningful to other
    HiPer-SEEK functions. Although you may inspect the value of the handle,
    its value is arbitrary and of no significance except to other HiPer-SEEK
    functions.  Under no circumstances should your application ever change
    the value of a HiPer-SEEK handle.

  Example:

    nBufSize := 8    // Make HiPer-SEEK buffer 8K
    nKeySize := 3    // Use largest index size (64 bytes per record)
    lCase    := .T.  // Upper and lower case are equal
    nFilter  := 1    // strip non-printing characters

    SET DELETED OFF  // Insure that deleted records are added to the index

    USE test EXCL    // Open database
    SET ORDER TO 0   // Make sure index is built in natural order

    h := <B>hs_Create( "SALES.HSX", nBufSize, nKeySize, lCase, nFilter )</B>
    IF h &lt; 0
      ? "Error creating HiPer-SEEK index!"
    ENDIF
