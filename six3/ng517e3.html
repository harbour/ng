  <B>SET TAG TO:</B>
  <B>SET ORDER TO:</B>

  Syntax:

  <B>SET TAG TO [&lt;tagname&gt; [OF &lt;indexname&gt;]]</B>
  <B>SET ORDER TO [TAG &lt;tagname&gt; [OF &lt;indexname&gt;]]</B>

  <B>TAG &lt;tagname&gt;</B> specifies the name of the tag to set the order to.  If a
  .CDX/.NSX file is not specified, then the open .CDX's are searched for the
  tag in the order that they were opened.  Once the tag is found, the order
  is set to its .CDX/.NSX file, and control is given to the tag specified.

  <B>OF &lt;cdxname&gt;</B> specifies which .CDX/.NSX file contains the specified tag.
  This is used to eliminate any conflicts between two .CDX's that may each
  have a tag of the same name.  Order is set to the specified .CDX/.NSX, and
  specified tag is given control.

  If no tagname is specified, then order is set to 0 (record # order).
  For example:

      <B>SET ORDER TO</B>
  and
      <B>SET TAG TO</B>

  are both equivalent to:

      <B>SET ORDER TO 0</B>


    NOTE:  The SET TAG and SET ORDER TO TAG commands are NOT supported
           under SIXNTX.  SET ORDER TO is supported as it is under DBFNTX.


  Example:


    // Assuming TEST.DBF has a TEST.CDX file with two tags, AGE and STATE

    #include "SIXCDX.CH"

    USE test VIA "SIXCDX"     // Open TEST.DBF and TEST.CDX
    <B>SET TAG TO age</B>            // Selects the AGE tag

    INDEX ON last TO last     // Create a new LAST.IDX file at the end of the
                              // order.  In this case, it's in order 3.  The
                              // two tags in TEST.CDX (AGE and STATE) are
                              // orders 1 and 2.

    <B>SET ORDER TO 2</B>            // Selects the STATE tag from within TEST.CDX

    <B>SET TAG TO age</B>            // Selects the AGE tag within TEST.CDX

    <B>SET ORDER TO 3</B>            // Selects LAST.IDX, which was in order 3
