  <B>FoxPro Compatibility:</B>

  The SIx Driver (SIXCDX) databases, indexes and memo files are 100%
  compatible with Microsoft's FoxPro 2.  Any database, index, and memo
  files created by the SIx Driver (SIXCDX) can be used under FoxPRO and
  vice-versa.

  This also means that if you are currently using R&amp;R Report Writer, you can
  continue to do so when using the SIx Driver (SIXCDX).  Just make sure that
  your release of R&amp;R supports FoxPro index and memo formats.

  <U>NOTE: The SIx Driver's SIXNSX flavor uses a proprietary index and memo</U>
  <U>      format that differs significantly from FoxPro's file formats.</U>
