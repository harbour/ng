  <B>Sx_Rollback():</B>

  Syntax:         Sx_Rollback( [nArea] )

                  nArea = Workarea number.

  Returns:   &lt;logical&gt; .T. if rollback was successful.
                  .F. if an error occurred.

  Description:    This function allows you to force Clipper to re-read a
                  record from disk prior to a write, thereby allowing you
                  to edit directly into a field without concern for the
                  automatic write that is performed at the conclusion of a
                  READ.

                  If you specify the workarea (nArea) as 0, then the current
                  record and all child-related records (that are <B>currently</B>
                  being pointed to) will also be refreshed from the data on
                  disk.  Note that this does not imply that <B>all</B> child
                  records that may have been changed will be rolled back, but
                  only the ones that the record pointers for each child
                  workarea are <B>currently</B> on.

  Example:

    #include "INKEY.CH"
    #include "SIXCDX.CH"

    USE test VIA "SIXCDX"
    GO TOP

    CLEAR
    @ 11,25 SAY "First Name:" GET test-&gt;FIRST
    @ 12,25 SAY "Last Name :" GET test-&gt;LAST
    @ 13,25 SAY "Age       :" GET test-&gt;AGE
    @ 14,25 SAY "Married   :" GET test-&gt;MARRIED
    READ

    // If the user pressed &lt;Escape&gt;, restore all of the old field values
    IF LastKey() == K_ESC
      IF Alert( "Abort Edits?", {"Yes","No"} ) == 1
        <B>Sx_RollBack()</B>
      ENDIF
    ENDIF


  <U>NOTE:  See the ROLLBACK.PRG program for a more detailed, practical example.</U>
