  <B>SEEK.EXE:</B>


  The SEEK utility is very handy in making sure that the file you think your
  compiler and/or linker are using is the correct one.  SEEK will look for
  the specified file in the specified (or assumed) DOS environment path.

  For example, if you think that your linker may be picking up an old version
  of your BOGUS.LIB file somewhere in your LIB path, SEEK will tell you.  It
  will search your LIB path for the first BOGUS.LIB file that your linker
  would be using.

  If you're not sure which FOOBAR.CH file, CA-Clipper's preprocessor will be
  using, SEEK can tell you that as well.

  For obvious file extensions, there is no need to specify the environment
  path to search in, unless you want to force SEEK to look in a different
  environment path instead.  For example, if the file extension is .h, .ch,
  or .inc, SEEK will assume it's a header file and scan the INCLUDE path.

  SEEK will also optionally:

    <B>.</B>  List ALL of the specified files that were found in the selected DOS
       environment path.

    <B>.</B>  Change to the drive and directory of the found file.  Actually, for
       people who happen to nest their development files many levels deep,
       even when you know for sure which file is being used, this option can
       be used as a quick way to get to that directory.

    <B>.</B>  Copy the found file into the current directory.

    <B>.</B>  Display with a terse (single line, no title screen) output.  This is
       mainly useful when using SEEK in a batch file to display large groups
       of file paths.

  The command-line syntax for using SEEK.EXE is as follows:

    SEEK &lt;cFileName&gt; [&lt;cEnvPath&gt;] [options]

    Where:  &lt;cFileName&gt; = The file to search for.
             &lt;cEnvPath&gt; = Optional environment path to search for the
                          file in.  If no path is specified, obvious
                          defaults are assumed.

    Options:         /a = Find all occurrences of specified file in path.

                     /c = Copy the found file into the current directory.
                          (Not available if /a switch is used.)

                     /d = Change to the directory of the found file.
                          (Not available if /a switch is used.)

                     /t = Terse display (only show the SEEK result line)

   Examples:

    <B>SEEK BOGUS.LIB LIB</B>       // Searches LIB

    <B>SEEK STDIO.H INCLUDE</B>     // Searches INCLUDE

    <B>SEEK TEST.EXE PATH</B>       // Searches PATH

    <B>SEEK BOGUS.LIB</B>           // Assumes LIB

    <B>SEEK BOGUS.LNK</B>           // Assumes LIB

    <B>SEEK STDIO.H</B>             // Assumes INCLUDE

    <B>SEEK STD.CH</B>              // Assumes INCLUDE

    <B>SEEK DOIT.BAT</B>            // Assumes PATH


    // Search for TEST.EXE, but in the PRG environment path instead
    <B>SEEK TEST.EXE PRG</B>

    // Search for all MYUDC.CH files in INCLUDE path
    <B>SEEK MYUDC.CH /a</B>

    // Search for TEST.OBJ and copy it to the current directory
    <B>SEEK TEST.OBJ /c</B>

    // Search for DEMO.LIB, and change to the directory it's found in
    <B>SEEK DEMO.LIB /d</B>
