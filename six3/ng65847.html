  <B>Compound Indexes:</B>

  A Compound index is an index file that contains multiple indexes (called
  <B>tags</B>).  Compound indexes allow you to have several indexes available
  to your application while only using one file handle.  Once a compound
  index is opened, all the tags contained in the file are automatically
  updated as the records are changed.  The first tag in the compound index
  (in order of creation) is by default the active tag when the index is
  opened.

  You can have several compound indexes for a single database file, giving
  you the ability to go well beyond Clipper's normal 15 index limit.  A
  compound index can have as many as 50 tags.

  <U>NOTE:  The compound index format used by SIXCDX is FoxPro's .CDX format.</U>
  <U>       Under SIXNSX the compound index format is .NSX, SuccessWare's</U>
  <U>       proproetary, high-performance index format.</U>
