  <B>SIX???/1025   Write Not Allowed</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>An attempt was made to update a record in a work area which
             was opened for read-only access.

  <B>Solution:  </B>Correct the program.  Either suppress operations which update
             records or open the database (.dbf) file for read/write access.
             To obtain read/write access, remove the READONLY clause from the
             USE command.
