  <B>HiPer-SEEK (Integrated Fast Text Search Technology):</B>

  HiPer-SEEK is a relatively simple, yet powerful, system which uses Index
  Applications' Fast Text Search technology.  Married to the Mach SIx query
  optimizer, it provides unmatched power for high speed searches and
  filters.

  The HiPer-SEEK system is a set of functions which create and maintain a
  proprietary index file(s) enabling the rapid search of textual data from
  within Clipper compiled applications.  The HiPer-SEEK functions can be
  used to index and search any character based information the application
  can access.
