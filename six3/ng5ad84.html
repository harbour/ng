  <B>SIX???/643  Attempt To Update RYO Index in READ ONLY Mode</B>

  <B>Problem:  </B>A call to Sx_KeyAdd() was made while the table was opened
            in READ ONLY mode.  Index files are always opened in the same
            mode as the database.

  <B>Solution:  </B>Table must be opened in SHARED or EXCLUSIVE mode to do key
             updates.
