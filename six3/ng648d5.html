  <B>VariFields (tm):</B>

  Under SIx 2.0 the term <B>VariField</B> referred primarily to ability to
  store and retrieve variable data types into a MEMO field.  For  example,
  an array stored in MEMO field would return "A" from Clipper's ValType()
  function.  This concept is still supported in SIx 3.0.


  <B>Variable Data Type Storage:</B>

  Besides being able to store arrays into FPT/SMT memo files, the SIx Driver
  also allows you store any Clipper data type (except code-blocks) into
  an FPT/SMT memo field.  This includes numeric, logical, and date values.
  Of course character values are supported as always!

  The neat thing is, for the particular record that you're on at the time,
  the <B>type</B> of that memo field will depend on what data type was stored in
  it.  By default, if nothing at all or plain text is stored in the memo
  field, Clipper's ValType() function returns "M".  However, after storing a
  different data type in the memo field, the ValType() return value for that
  particular record will reflect the value that was stored.  For example:


    <B>// Assuming TEST.DBF has a memo field called NOTES</B>

    <B>USE test VIA "SIXNSX"</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "M"</B>

    <B>test-&gt;NOTES := Date()        // Store a date value into the NOTES field</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "M"</B>

    <B>test-NOTES := 1000           // Store a numeric value into NOTES</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "N"</B>

    <B>test-&gt;NOTES := .T.           // Store a logical value into NOTES</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "L"</B>

    <B>test-&gt;NOTES := { 1, 2, 3 }   // Store an array into NOTES</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "A"</B>

    <B>test-&gt;NOTES := "Testing..."  // Store plain text into NOTES</B>
    <B>? ValType( test-&gt;NOTES )     // "M"</B>


  <B>Variable Length Fields:</B>

  In SIx 3.0, a new field type -- 'V' -- has been added.  There are
  <B>weakly-typed</B> and <B>strongly-typed</B> VariFields.

  Depending on the structure and content on your particular database
  file(s), it's possible to cut the size of your data files in half using
  "V" fields.  The <B>OTTO.EXE</B> utility can assist you in converting your
  existing database files to store data more efficiently using 'V' fields.
