  <B>Sx_AutoOpen():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_AutoOpen( [bMode] )

            bMode = Optional logical value indicating the Auto Open mode to
                    be used for structural .CDX and .NSX files.  By default,
                    this is TRUE (.T.), and will automatically open a
                    structural .CDX/.NSX file, if found, when its associate
                    table is opened.  Setting this value to FALSE (.F.) will
                    cause structural index files to not open automatically.

  Returns:  Logical value indicating the current, or previous, mode.

  Description:  Sx_AutoOpen() gives you control over the automatic opening
                features of structural .CDX or .NSX indexes.  By default, if
                TEST.DBF is opened VIA "SIXCDX", the SIx Driver looks for an
                associated TEST.CDX file.  If one is found, it is also opened
                automatically.  Passing a .F. value to this function will
                require you to open all indexes explicitly.

    NOTE:  This function is NOT supported under SIXNTX.

         f you share data with FoxPro applications, you should not
         ircumvent the autoopen feature. The reason is that FoxPro
         ocks (and likewise SIXCDX locks) are set differently depending
         n whether or not there is a structural index. Thus, a Foxpro
         pplication with an open DBF/CDX will not see the locks set by
          SIXCDX application that has circumvented the AUTO OPEN...
         nd visa-versa.

  Examples:

    ? <B>Sx_AutoOpen()</B>         // Returns .T. (Default)

    USE test VIA "SIXCDX"   // Also opens TEST.CDX, if one exists

    <B>Sx_AutoOpen(.F.)</B>        // Disable the Auto Open feature

    USE test2 VIA "SIXCDX"  // Does not attempt to open TEST2.CDX
