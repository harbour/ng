  <B>Why does my .CDX/.NSX keep growing when I re-create an existing tag?:</B>

  When an existing tag in a compound index (.CDX or .NSX) is rebuilt using
  INDEX ON ... TAG ... the space from the original tag is not automatically
  reclaimed.  Instead, the new tag is added to the end of the file, causing
  the file size to increase.

  You can use the REINDEX command to "pack" the index file.  REINDEX
  rebuilds each tag, eliminating any unused space in the file.

  If you rebuild your indexes on a regular basis, it is recommended that
  you either delete your .CDX/.NSX files before rebuilding the tags, or use
  the REINDEX command to rebuild them instead.


    <U>NOTE:  This behavior is the same as in FoxPro.</U>
