  <B>SIX???/1012   Corruption Detected</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>File corruption has been detected in the specified file.

  <B>Solution:  </B>Make sure that the file type is correct for the operation.

             A common cause of this error for new SIx Driver users is when
             your application uses a .DBF file with a .DBT memo file.  If
             you open these files VIA "SIXCDX" or "SIXNSX", you'll get this
             error because the .DBT memo file format is not the default
             memo format supported under these drivers.  To correct this
             situation, you must do one of the following:

               . Link in the DBT.OBJ file.  This makes the SIx Driver's
                 SIXCDX and/or SIXNSX flavors use default to .DBT memos
                 instead of their usual defauts of .FPT and .SMT respec-
                 tively.

               . Use the MEMOCONV.PRG sample program (located with your
                 other SIx Driver sample programs) to convert your existing
                 .DBF/.DBT combos into the proper .DBF/.FPT or .DBF/.SMT
                 format required by your selected SIx Driver flavor.
