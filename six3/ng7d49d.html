  <B>Why am I getting IE1010 Errors and/or lockups?:</B>

  A common cause of IE1010 errors, lockups, and other odd behavior is if
  your stack size is set too low in your link script file.

  The SIXNSX flavor of the SIx Driver <B>requires</B> 7k of stack space, which
  we "burn" into the SIX3.LIB file.  SIXCDX and SIXNTX do not require any
  additional stack space (over what DBFNTX would normally require).

  However, if you have an explicit STACK or PROCEDURE DEPTH setting in your
  link script file, it will override the one burned into our library.  Also,
  if your application is using other add-on libraries written in C/ASM, it
  may require additional stack space above and beyond what the SIx Driver
  itself requires.

  If you get an IE1010 Error, check your link script file.  If you have a
  STACK line, make sure it is set to at least 7168.  For example:

    <B>STACK 7068</B>

  If it is set lower than 7068, try setting it to 7068 or higher and
  relinking your application.

  If you are not using the STACK command, but are instead using the
  PROCEDURE DEPTH command, it should be set to 70 or above.  For example:

    <U>For Blinker:</U>

      <B>BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH 70</B>

    <U>For ExoSpace:</U>

      <B>EXOSPACE PROCEDURE DEPTH 70</B>


  Note that the STACK and PROCEDURE DEPTH commands both achieve the same
  result, but in two different ways.  Only one of the two commands needs
  to be used at a time.  You should not use both in the same link script.

  As mentioned above, the SIXNSX driver is the most common flavor that you
  may need to adjust your stack size for.  However, if you experience IE1010
  errors under SIXCDX and/or SIXNTX as well, the first thing to try is the
  suggestions listed above.

  After relinking your application with the revised stack size setting, you
  should also rebuild your index files.
