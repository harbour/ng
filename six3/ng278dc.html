  <B>Sx_File2BLOB():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_File2BLOB( &lt;cFileName&gt;, &lt;cFldName&gt; [,&lt;nActionCode&gt;] )

        cFileName = The name of the file to be stored in the memo file.

         cFldName = The name of the memo field to store the file in.

      nActionCode = Optional numeric code indicating an action to be taken
                    on the file as it is stored to the database.  The
                    default is no action (The file is stored as-is).

                    These action code values are defined as manifest
                    constants in the SIXCDX.CH file as follows:

                      BLOB_FILECOMPRESS  = Compress the file
                      BLOB_FILEENCRYPT   = Encrypt the file

                    NOTE:  Although these constants preprocess into numeric
                           values, you should not use the numeric values in
                           your source code.  Instead, you should use the
                           constants, as defined above.  This will insure
                           compatibility with all future releases of the
                           SIx Driver.

  Returns:   Logical.  TRUE (.T.) if successful, FALSE (.F.) if not.

  Description:   Sx_File2BLOB() will store a file of any type (ASCII or
                 binary) into an .FPT/.SMT memo field.  The file to be stored
                 can be of any size.  The file can also be optionally
                 compressed or encrypted as it's stored in the memo field.

                 The term "BLOB" is an acronym for <B>B</B>inary <B>L</B>arge <B>OB</B>ject,
                 which means basically any type of binary data, not just
                 plain ASCII text that would normally be associated with
                 memo fields.

    NOTE:  This function is NOT supported under SIXNTX.

  Examples:

    USE test VIA "SIXCDX"  // Open TEST.DBF and TEST.FPT

    // Read the IMAGE.PCX file into the NOTES field, with compression
    <B>Sx_File2BLOB( "IMAGE.PCX", "NOTES", BLOB_FILECOMPRESS )</B>
