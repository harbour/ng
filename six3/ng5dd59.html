  <B>Notes For International Users ONLY:</B>


    <B>NOTE:  This section only applies to people using the International</B>
    <B>       releases of CA-Clipper and SIx 3.0.  If you are using the</B>
    <B>       Domestic (U.S.) releases of CA-Clipper and SIx 3.0, this section</B>
    <B>       does not apply to you at all.</B>


  In order to use the International SIx 3.0 release, you must also link in
  one additional .OBJ module for your language's character sorting order.
  These .OBJ files will have been installed in the same directory as the
  other SIx Driver .OBJ files. By default, this would be in the \SIX3\OBJ
  directory.  The foreign nation modules currently included with the SIx 3.0
  release are as follows:

    <B>SIXUK.OBJ    - Standard (American/British)</B>
    <B>SIXDAN.OBJ   - Danish                     </B>
    <B>SIXDUT.OBJ   - Dutch                      </B>
    <B>SIXFIN.OBJ   - Finnish                    </B>
    <B>SIXFRE.OBJ   - French                     </B>
    <B>SIXGER.OBJ   - German                     </B>
    <B>SIXIC850.OBJ - Icelandic (Code page 850)  </B>
    <B>SIXIC861.OBJ - Icelandic (Code page 861)  </B>
    <B>SIXITA.OBJ   - Italian                    </B>
    <B>SIXNOR.OBJ   - Norwegian                  </B>
    <B>SIXPOR.OBJ   - Portuguese                 </B>
    <B>SIXSPA.OBJ   - Spanish                    </B>
    <B>SIXSWE.OBJ   - Swedish                    </B>

  For example, to link the German sort module into your SIXNSX application,
  you would include the SIXGER.OBJ like this:

    <B>BLINKER FI test, sixger, sixnsx LI six3</B>


  <B>NOTE:  Failure to include one of the nations modules will result in</B>
  <B>       Unresolved External errors for the following four symbols at</B>
  <B>       link-time:</B>  <U>__ZCMP, __NPREVC, __NNEXTC, and __FORCE_ASCII.</U>
