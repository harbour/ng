  <B>HiPer-SEEK Tips:</B>
  <B>----------------</B>


  <B>Indexing and Filtering:</B>

  Application developers may get into trouble with HiPer-SEEK if they
  forget that in order to produce an accurate HiPer-SEEK index, the records
  of the primary .DBF that will be searched must be passed to hs_Add() in
  their natural order. This means that when a HiPer-SEEK index is created
  SET DELETED should be OFF and, assuming that there are active Clipper
  indexes, that SET ORDER TO should be 0. Likewise, there should be no
  active filter conditions when a HiPer-SEEK index is generated.

  To work correctly HiPer-SEEK must create an index record for each record
  in the primary database file. HiPer-SEEK does not store .DBF record
  numbers, rather the values returned by hs_Add() and hs_Next() are derived
  from the position of the index record in the index file.

  Once the HiPer-SEEK index is completed, an application can restore
  Clipper indexes, turn DELETED ON, and establish FILTERS.

  With Clipper indexes restored, records can be appended to the primary
  database and to the HiPer-SEEK index without trouble, because appended
  records are always added to the end of the .DBF and the HiPer-SEEK index
  file.  Consequently, the HiPer-SEEK index order will be maintained. Once
  again, it is a good idea to always test the values returned by hs_Add()
  against the current .DBF record number. A difference can indicate a
  problem.


  <B>Packing .DBFs:</B>

  Whenever an application packs .DBF files, HiPer-SEEK indexes that
  reference the packed .DBFs must be regenerated. Just as Clipper has to
  regenerate its indexes to account for eliminated records, HiPer-SEEK must
  do the same.  There must always be a one-to-one, top-to-bottom
  relationship between the records in the primary .DBF and the records in
  the HiPer-SEEK index.


  <B>Reusing Records:</B>

  Rather than delete records and pack .DBF files, some developers try to
  save time and minimize maintenance by instituting a system by which they
  mark the record in such a way that the .DBF's index moves the record
  either to the end or the beginning of the file where it can be reclaimed
  for future use.

  Developers who use this technique should not have a problem with
  HiPer-SEEK provided that they perform a hs_Replace() if their delete mark
  involves the text that has been indexed and that they check against
  accidentally verifying their deleted records during a search.


  <B>Large Memos and Text Files:</B>

  Among HiPer-SEEK's strengths is its ability to index and search
  arbitrarily long sections of text. Anxious to exploit this capability,
  some developers may use HiPer-SEEK to index large (4000 bytes+) memo
  fields.  As implemented the library works as it should, but performance
  can suffer due to an increased number of aliases (invalid hits) returned
  by the HiPer-SEEK system.  Nevertheless, even in these conditions,
  HiPer-SEEK performance remains superior to that of other searching
  schemes.

  If a developer is faced with this situation, the best advice, at least
  for now, is to consider how these big blocks of text might be broken down
  into smaller and more manageable chunks. For example, index on paragraphs
  instead of pages or on whole documents. The user interface may be more of
  a challenge to implement, but the payoff in ease-of-use will be well
  worth the effort.  Anything that can be done to reduce the ratio of
  source string length to index size will help; perhaps indexing on only
  the first few thousand characters of each memo field, or creating
  separate indexes for data fields and memo fields. Also, remember that the
  more unique (usually longer) the search (target) string is, the fewer
  aliases returned and the faster the search can be completed.


  <B>Embedded CHR(0):</B>

  Because HiPer-SEEK is written primarily in C and because its string
  handling routines follow the C convention of treating ASCII 0 as the
  end-of- string character, embedded CHR(0)s have undesirable affects on
  the accuracy of HiPer-SEEK indexes.

  If an application runs into this problem, the solution is to replace the
  CHR(0)s with another character before passing the string to HiPer-SEEK
  for indexing. Any character will do, though one above ASCII 127 is
  recommended.  If the application needs to use the character in searches,
  be sure to set the HiPer-SEEK filter to 2 when creating the index.
  Because HiPer-SEEK filter 1 strips the eighth bit, the information
  contained in these odd characters will be lost when the index record is
  created.
