  <B>Can I use .DBT's with the SIx Driver?:</B>

  Yes.  To do so, simply include <B>DBT.OBJ</B> in your link command or link
  script.  This will cause the SIx driver to use Clipper .DBT files for memo
  fields.

  However, There are some good reasons for using FPT or SMT memos.  Most
  important is definable block size.  Clipper's .DBT's use a fixed block
  size of 512 bytes.  That means that every time you store even 1 byte in
  a memo field Clipper uses 512 bytes to store it.  And if the data in a
  memo field grows to 513 bytes, then TWO blocks required.

  When creating FPT's or SMT's, you can define the block size (from 16 to
  1024 bytes) so that it's optimized for your specific needs.  The default
  block size for FPT's is 64 bytes.  A simple conversion from DBTs to
  FPT/SMTs will generally shrink your memo files by over 50%.
