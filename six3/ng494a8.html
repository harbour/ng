  <B>LIST:</B>

  Syntax:

  <B>LIST &lt;exp list&gt; [TO PRINTER] [TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;]</B>
  <B>     [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;] [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;] </B>
  <B>     [OFF] [NOOPTIMIZE]</B>

  <B>&lt;exp list&gt;</B> is the list of expressions to be evaluated and displayed
  for each record processed.

  <B>TO PRINTER</B> echoes output to the printer.

  <B>TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;</B> echoes output to the specified filename and can be
  specified either as a literal filename or as a character expression
  enclosed in parentheses.  If an extension is not specified, (.TXT) is
  added.

  <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to LIST.  The default
  is ALL records.  The scope must be ALL to be optimized by Mach SIx.

  <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the condition from
  the current record until the condition fails.  Mach SIx does not support the
  WHILE condition.

  <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records to LIST within
  the given scope.  Mach SIx will optimize any FOR condition that contains one
  or more active index keys.

  <B>OFF</B> suppresses the display of record numbers.

  <B>NOOPTIMIZE</B>, preempts optimization and forces default Clipper processing.

  <B>Description:</B>

  LIST is a console command that sequentially accesses records in the
  current work area, displaying the results of one or more expressions for
  each record accessed.  The output is in tabular format with each column
  separated by a space.  LIST is identical to DISPLAY with the exception that
  its default scope is ALL rather than NEXT 1.

  When invoked, output is sent to the screen and optionally to the printer
  and/or a file.  To suppress output to the screen while printing or echoing
  output to a file, SET CONSOLE OFF before the LIST invocation.

  The LIST command may be optimized by specifying one or more active index
  keys in the FOR condition.  Note that Mach SIx will only optimize a LIST
  with a FOR condition and a scope of ALL.  WHILE conditions and alternate
  scopes cannot be optimized by Mach SIx.

  <B>Notes:</B>

  <B>Interrupting LIST:</B>  The Clipper guide suggests using a test for INKEY() in
  the FOR condition in order to interrupt LIST processing.  Because of the
  way Mach SIx parses and evaluates the FOR condition this technique is not
  recommended and might produce unexpected results.

  <B>Printer margin:</B> LIST honors the current SET MARGIN for output echoed to
  the printer.
