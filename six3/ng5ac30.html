  <B>SIX???/642  Key Not In Index</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>The key that is being removed (using Sx_KeyDrop()) was not
             found in the index.

  <B>Solution:  </B>This is an informational warning.  If your program depends
             on the key actually being removed, make sure the key exists in
             the index before trying to remove it.
