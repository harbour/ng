  <B>Using HiPer-SEEK:</B>

  The HiPer-SEEK for Clipper system has been designed to offer the
  developer great flexibility and provide an inexpensive solution for the
  great majority of text search problems. The HiPer-SEEK functions are used
  to create, maintain and search one or more HiPer-SEEK index files. In the
  demonstration programs, these index files are given the extension .HSX
  and this document will refer to HiPer-SEEK index files as .HSX files.

  HiPer-SEEK indexes contain fixed length keys (index records) which track
  the contents of text records. A text record may consist of any arbitrary
  block of text. In the case of a .DBF (Clipper) format file, a text record
  would usually consist of the concatenation of selected fields from a data
  record. A text record might also be a line or paragraph from a text file
  or even an entire file.  For example, a correspondence
  management/tracking system made up of many individual WordPerfect files
  might be structured so that each file is a text record. In all cases,
  there will be one index record for each and every text record. This one
  to one relationship is critical to the proper operation of a HiPer-SEEK
  system.

  An .HSX file is created by hs_Create(). hs_Create() builds the .HSX file
  header and establishes the index's attributes. It does not add records to
  the file. This is done by hs_Add().

  The contents of each text record are passed to HiPer-SEEK, a key is built
  according to the parameters of hs_Create() and an index record is added
  to the .HSX file using hs_Add().  These index records are given numbers
  (beginning with 1) which are returned by hs_Add().  Index record numbers
  are not database record numbers. They are created by HiPer-SEEK and are
  incremented by one as each record is added.

  Again using the example of a .DBF file, if the records are read and
  passed to HiPer-SEEK in natural order (that is, not in an index order),
  the database record numbers will be the same as the index record numbers.
  If each text record is a line of text, each index record number will
  correspond to a line number.  HiPer-SEEK is not aware of the origin of
  the text strings it receives. It merely receives a string, constructs an
  index key, adds that key to the .HSX file, increments its internal
  counter and returns the value of the counter.  It is the responsibility
  of the application to manage the text records. HiPer-SEEK will manage the
  index records.

  The .HSX file is initially built like other types of indexes.
  Maintenance operations such as adds, replaces, deletes and undeletes are
  performed on individual index records. The .HSX file will not have to be
  rebuilt unless the data on which it is based is significantly altered. An
  example of this is when a .DBF file is PACKED. A PACK will remove all
  data records that have been marked for deletion. The .HSX file must be
  rebuilt if any .DBF records were removed because the one to one
  relationship between data records (text records) and index records would
  have been destroyed.  Similarly, if files in a document database or lines
  of a text file were erased, the related .HSX indexes should be rebuilt.

  Searches are performed by passing the string or strings being searched
  for (search string) to HiPer-SEEK along with the identifier of the
  appropriate .HSX file. The .HSX file is searched and the index record
  numbers of those records containing matches are returned. The text record
  related to each returned index record number is then inspected to verify
  that a match has actually been found. This verification process is
  necessary because HiPer-SEEK will sometimes return aliases. See
  hs_Verify().

  An .HSX index is not an inversion or compression of the original textual
  data. Its keys track the occurrence of text signatures. It identifies
  matches as those index records containing all the signatures or
  attributes of the search string(s). It is possible that differing strings
  will resolve to the same signature. We refer to these as aliases. It is
  important to note that while an .HSX index search may mistakenly identify
  a record as containing a match, it will never fail to find a record that
  does match. The speed of the index search allows for verification as well
  as other post search operations and still provide exceptionally rapid
  results.

  As mentioned above, the HiPer-SEEK system has been built to provide fast
  text searches in a wide variety of applications. There are limits
  however.  It will be less useful in two extreme situations. The first is
  where text records are very small. The smallest .HSX index key is 16
  bytes. When individual text records are also that small the index file
  overhead can be 100% or more. The other extreme is where individual text
  records are very large. The largest choice for an .HSX index key is 64
  bytes. It is easy to imagine that indexing 64 kilobytes of text with a
  single 64 byte key is not practical.  Additionally, because HiPer-SEEK
  identifies matches on a text record level, there would still be
  significant work left to find the string(s) within the 64K block of text
  that HiPer-SEEK identifies as containing a match. See the <B>Index</B>
  <B>Creation</B> section for more on record vs. key size.
