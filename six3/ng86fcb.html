  <B>Technical Support:</B>

  We at SuccessWare are making every effort to provide you with quality
  software and clear, concise documentation.  In many cases, the answer to
  any problems may be addressed in the <B>Getting Started</B> or <B>Commonly Asked</B>
  <B>Questions</B> sections of this guide, or in the <B>README.1ST</B> file on the
  distribution diskette.

  In addition, we offer quick and effective technical support. If you should
  encounter a problem or question that is not covered by the documentation,
  you can receive technical support in one of the following ways:


  <B>Option 1:</B>  <U>CompuServe</U>

    You can reach us on CompuServe by electronic mail or on our section
