  <B>Conditional and Scoped Indexes:</B>

  The SIx Driver can be used to create indexes with a built-in FOR clause.
  Think about it - fully maintainable conditional indexes!  The condition
  can be any expression, including a User-Defined Function (UDF).  As the
  database is updated, only records that match the index condition are added
  to the index, and records that satisfied the condition before but don't
  any longer are automatically removed.  Clean and simple.

  Indexes can also be given a temporary scope after they've been created.
  The SIx Driver's SET SCOPE commands and functions let you set high and low
  key limits so that you see only the range of records that you want.  The
  index scoping feature is similar to SET FILTER, except it work on indexes
  and is MUCH faster!

    <U>NOTE: In cases where a SCOPE cannot be used, our Mach SIx query</U>
    <U>      optimizer can be used to optimize SET FILTER.  In many cases,</U>
    <U>      a SET FILTER under Mach SIx may be nearly as fast as a SCOPE.</U>

  Also, you can set a scope for each index or tag, and the scope remains
  active as long as the index in open.  One limitation that index scopes
  have is that the specified values must be constant values.  If an expres-
  sion or UDF is supplied as the value, then the value of the expression or
  return value from the UDF is used for the value.  This eliminates the
  slow-down from constant re-evaluation of a filter expression.
