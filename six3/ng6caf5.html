  <B>Mach SIx Features:</B>

   <B>.</B> AUTOMATICALLY optimizes the following Clipper commands:

      <B>AVERAGE</B>
      <B>CONTINUE</B>
      <B>COUNT</B>
      <B>COPY [SDF] [DELIMITED]</B>
      <B>DELETE</B>
      <B>DISPLAY</B>
      <B>INDEX</B>
      <B>LABEL</B>
      <B>LIST</B>
      <B>LOCATE</B>
      <B>RECALL</B>
      <B>REPLACE</B>
      <B>REPORT</B>
      <B>SET FILTER</B>
      <B>SORT</B>
      <B>SUM</B>
      <B>TOTAL</B>

   <B>.</B> ORDER aliasing provides a way to specify exactly what indexes
     are used to optimize a query.   All open indexes qualify, including
     Roll-Your-Own, Conditional, Unique, and Partial indexes.

   <B>.</B> Roll-Your-Own filter functions provide a powerful yet intuitive
     interface to MachSIx's internal filtering engine.

   <B>.</B> Automatic static filtering of the non-optimizable portion of
     a query improves SET FILTER performance by only testing that part
     of the query against the record once.  If the test fails then the
     record is never visited again.

   <B>.</B> Full expression testing prevents mid-process error detection by
     validating the entire query expression before optimizing begins.

   <B>.</B> Query expressions can be specified in either literal or extended
     expression form.  An extended expression differs from a literal one
     in that you store the desired query expression into a character
     variable and specify that variable name surrounded by parenthesis in
     place of the literal expression.

          COUNT TO nCount FOR state="CA"     // literal form

          cCond := 'state = "CA"'
          COUNT TO nCount for (cCond)        // extended form

   <B>.</B> Dynamically build and optimize queries with up to 250 items!
     That's far beyond the 256 character limit of Clipper.  (An item is any
     simple expression or logical operator.)

   <B>.</B> Optimize queries on databases with up to 524 million records.

   <B>.</B> Optimized code block scan of a database with <B>m6_dbEval()</B>, our
     version of Clipper's dbEval().

   <B>.</B> Copy database records to an <B>array</B> for program manipulation or
     for use with TBrowse() using <B>COPY TO ARRAY</B>.

   <B>.</B> Store database record numbers to an <B>array</B> for later processing
     with the <B>SEARCH FOR</B> command.

   <B>.</B> Full <B>and</B> Partial index keys are optimizable.  Other query
     optimizers require the index key in the criteria to be an <U>exact</U> match
     of an indexed expression.  This is <B>not</B> the case with Mach SIx.  Only
     the left most portion of the key must match.

     For example, an index expression built on LAST+FIRST is optimizable on
     just LAST.

   <B>.</B> Full <B>and</B> Partial optimization of a FOR clause is supported.  A fully
     optimizable expression is one where all expressions in the FOR clause
     are indexed.  A partially optimizable expression is where at least one
     expression in the FOR clause is indexed.  In the case of partial
     optimization, non-indexed expressions piggy-back one or more indexed
     expressions in the FOR criteria.

   <B>.</B> Smart translations of indexed expressions embedded in functions into
     optimizable expressions.  Mach SIx extends the idea of partial index
     keys into actually recognizing the existence of a key imbedded in a
     function call, and then translating it into an optimizable expression.

     For example, <B>Empty(LAST)</B> becomes <B>LAST = Space(15)</B>, <B>Year(DATE) = 1992</B>
     becomes <B>DtoS(DATE) = "1992"</B>, etc...  As long as you have an index built
     on the translation, the expression is optimizable.

   <B>.</B> Short-cutting.  Mach SIx was designed with the same short-cutting
     technology found in the Clipper compiler.  If an expression joined by
     an .AND. fails, the evaluation immediately faults, and resumes with
     the next .OR.'ed expression, if one exists.

   <B>.</B> Seamless integration.  SET FILTER optimizations are handled
     automatically.  To optimize other supported commands using a FOR
     condition, just #include the MACHSIX.CH header file at the top of your
     source file (after the SIx Driver header file), recompile, and your
     existing code will be <U>automatically</U> optimized for the commands
     supported.

   <B>.</B> Relationships supported through partial optimization.  Just make sure
     that one expression in the FOR clause is indexed.  Better yet, index on
     the relationship, and the expression will be <U>fully</U> optimizable.

   <B>.</B> Measure the level optimization of the FOR criteria prior to issuing an
     optimizable command, with the <B>m6_IsOptimize()</B> function.
