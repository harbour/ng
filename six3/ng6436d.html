  <B>Mach SIx Query Optimizer:</B>

  The Mach SIx Query Optimizer is an integrated system that provides
  high-speed query optimization for SET FILTER and other selected Clipper
  commands when used with a FOR condition.  Mach SIx optimizes queries by
  following a procedural set of steps that determine the best access plan
  to retrieve the requested set of data.  Mach SIx's primary focus is on
  the existence of index key expressions in the FOR criteria of its
  supported commands and functions.  Using this information, Mach SIx is
  able to directly search the index files to satisfy all or part of the
  query without ever having to access the database.
