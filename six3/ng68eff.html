  <B>Data Encryption:</B>

  The SIx Driver's enryption functions provide an easy way to integrate data
  security to a system.  The encryption engine provides security through the
  use of a 64-bit (8 byte) security code and multi-adaptive computation.
  Multi-adaptive computation ensures a wide uniqueness within the outputted
  encrypted string.  If a string of all blanks were encrypted you would see
  a wide distribution of characters.  This ensures a reasonable amount of
  security at a small speed penalty.

  Of course, the best way to protect your data is to keep it away from those
  who shouldn't have access to it.  Protect your passwords, and don't store
  them in .DBF files.

  This encryption/decryption method is <B>not</B> DES (Data Encryption Standard)
  compliant, so it can be used in programs distributed both in the US and
  Overseas.
