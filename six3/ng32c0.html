  <B>hs_Add():</B>

  Purpose:  Adds a text string entry to a HiPer-SEEK index file.

   Syntax:  hs_Add( &lt;hIndex&gt;, &lt;bExpr&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;hIndex&gt; is an integer handle of a HiPer-SEEK index file.

            &lt;bExpr&gt; is a code block that will be evaluated for the current
              record to extract the key data to be added to the index.

     Note:  There is no length limit to the index string, however, strings
            of length of less than 4000 characters usually provide the
            best results.  Strings longer than this can result in higher
            alias rates and sometimes in unsatisfactory performance.  It
            is often worthwhile to experiment with the SIZE FACTOR
            parameter of hs_Create() in order to optimize performance.

  Returns:  An integer representing the record number.  Errors are
            indicated by integers less than zero. This value can be used
            to insure that the index file is being built correctly. See
            comment 5 below.

  Errors Returned:

      -4 (BADSEEK) Error while attempting seek during buffer flushing.
      -6 (BADWRITE) Error while attempting write during buffer flush.
     -16 (BADPARMS) Invalid parameters were passed to the function.
     -18 (BADHANDLE) Invalid handle was passed to the function.

  Comments:

    1.  Return values start with one and increase. This integer is an
    internally incremented counter and indicated the record position within
    the index file. The first time hs_Add() is called it will return a 1,
    the second time, a 2, and so on. These return values represent the
    position within the index file held by the key for the string passed.
    These numbers will always increase by one for each add, even if records
    are deleted in the interim. In most cases the first time hs_Add() is
    called it will receive a string (&lt;cExpr&gt;) from .DBF record number 1; the
    second time from .DBF record number 2, and so on. If this method is
    continued, all index record numbers will directly correspond to .DBF
    record numbers.

    2.  If possible, when adding a large number of records, try to add them
    consecutively without calling other HiPer-SEEK functions in between
    adds.  This allows maximum buffering to occur and results in increased
    speed.

    3.  When first adding records to a newly created index file remember to
    SET DELETED OFF and SET ORDER TO 0. This is to insure that no records
    are passed over and that records are added in natural order.  These two
    commands are not necessary when adding individual records because both
    the .DBF and index records will be added to the end of the files.

    4.  Care should be taken when laying out the logic for adding records to
    .DBFs and .HSX index files. Interruption of the process might result in
    a record being added to the .DBF and not being added to the .HSX file;
    or, a record being added to the .HSX index and not to the .DBF.  The
    first situation will eventually result in a -7 (RECBOUND) error. The
    second situation will result in inaccurate searches.

    5.  It is a very good idea to compare the value of the return from
    hs_Add() with the current .DBF record number. These values should be
    equal. Unequal values indicate that the primary .DBF file and its .HSX
    index file are out of sync.


  Example:

    USE test EXCL
    h := hs_Open( "SALES.HSX", 10, 1 )
    bExpr := { || Trim( test-&gt;FIRST ) + " " + Trim( test-&gt;LAST ) }
    DO WHILE !eof()
      nRec := <B>hs_Add( h, bExpr )</B>
      IF nRec &lt; 1 .OR. nRec != RecNo()
        ? "Error adding record " + LTrim( Str( RecNo() )) + "!"
      ENDIF
      SKIP
    ENDDO
