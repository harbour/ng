  <B>CONTINUE:</B>

  Syntax:

  <B>CONTINUE [NOOPTIMIZE]</B>

  <B>NOOPTIMIZE</B>, preempts optimization and forces default Clipper processing.

  Description:

  CONTINUE is a database command that searches from the current record
  position for the next record meeting the most recent LOCATE condition
  executed in the current work area.  It terminates when a match is found
  or end of file is encountered.  If CONTINUE is successful, the matching
  record becomes the current record and FOUND() returns true (.T.); if
  unsuccessful, FOUND() returns false (.F.).

  Each work area may have an active LOCATE condition.  In CA-Clipper, a
  LOCATE condition remains pending until a new LOCATE condition is specified.
  No other commands release the condition.

  <B>NOTE:  The scope and WHILE condition of the initial LOCATE are ignored.</B>
  <B>       only the FOR condition is used with CONTINUE.  If you are using a</B>
  <B>       LOCATE with a WHILE condition and want to continue the search for</B>
  <B>       a matching record, use SKIP and then repeat the original LOCATE</B>
  <B>       statement adding REST as the scope.</B>

  Example:

  #include "SIXCDX.CH"
  #include "MACHSIX.CH"

  USE claims
  INDEX on AMT_PAID tag AMT_PAID
  INDEX on REGION TAG REGION

  // show claims greater than 500,000 by region
  LOCATE FOR AMT_PAID &gt;= 500000
  WHILE found()
    ? "Region: ", REGION, " Amount: ", AMT_PAID
    <B>CONTINUE</B>
  ENDDO
