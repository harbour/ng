  <B>Logical Index Record Functions:</B>

  Have you ever tried to build a positional scroll bar for a browse routine?
  You know, those cool things along the side that show where your are within
  the file.  It's easy enough to do with a plain database - just divide the
  record count by RECNO() and you've got the position.  So what do you do
  with an indexed database?  And even more difficult, what if you have a
  conditional index?  You don't even know how many records you're dealing
  with!

  The answer is simple: Sx_KeyCount() and Sx_KeyNo(), the SIx Driver's
  index versions of RECCOUNT() and RECNO().  Sx_KeyCount() tells you how
  many keys are in an index, and Sx_KeyNo() returns the current position
  within the index.

  <U>NOTE:  See SCRLLBAR.PRG for a working demo of how to use Sx_KeyNo() and</U>
  <U>       Sx_KeyCount() to create a scroll bar for a browse window.</U>
