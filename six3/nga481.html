  <B>hs_Set():</B>

  Purpose:  Used in conjunction with hs_Next(), this is the first function
            called when performing a find operation.  The function takes the
            handle of a HiPer-SEEK index file as well as the text to be
            searched for as input.  hs_Set() does not perform the search.
            It only sets up the parameters.

   Syntax:  hs_Set( &lt;hIndex&gt;, &lt;cExpr&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;hIndex&gt; is an integer handle of a HiPer-SEEK index file.

            &lt;cExpr&gt; is a string containing the search criteria. Each sub-
              string to be searched for should be separated by blanks (it is
              not necessary to pad the front and back of the string with
              blanks). For example, the string "ed cat" would match all
              records in the index containing both "ed" and "cat" within
              them. Since it is a sub-string match, both "ed has a cat" and
              "The catalog was spray painted" would be valid matches. The
              order of the substrings in the search criteria is not
              important. For a successful match, all substrings in the
              search criteria must be present in the original indexed string.

  Returns:  1 if successful or a negative integer indicating an error.

  Errors Returned:

      -4 (BADSEEK) Error while attempting seek during buffer flushing.
      -6 (BADWRITE) Error while attempting write during buffer flush.
     -13 (NORECS) There are no records currently indexed. A search of the
         index (hs_Next()) would be fruitless.
     -16 (BADPARMS) Invalid parameters were passed to the function.
     -18 (BADHANDLE) Invalid handle was passed to the function.

  Comments:

    1.  It is acceptable to make other HiPer-SEEK calls between hs_Set() and
    hs_Next() and/or between hs_Next() calls. However, remember that if a
    record is edited and saved (hs_Replace()ed) it may not still be a
    qualified member of the verified hits. If a search is to be abandoned
    midstream, other HiPer-SEEK calls may be made without first completing
    the search.

  Example:

    USE test EXCL

    h := hs_Open( "LOOKUP.HSX", 4, 1 )
    <B>hs_Set( h, "Thompson" )</B>
    nRec := hs_Next( h )

    ? "The first record conaining 'Thompson' is #" + LTrim( Str( nRec ))

    hs_Close( h )
