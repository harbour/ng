  <B>SIX???/1010   Read Error</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>A read error occurred on the specified file.

  <B>Solution:  </B>If the file is on a floppy disk, make sure the disk is
             properly seated in the drive.  In a network environment, make
             sure the network connection is still valid; check for problems
             at the server.

        <B>       can also result in Internal Error 650.  You may need to</B>
        <B>       add or increase the STACK or PROCEDURE DEPTH settings</B>
        <B>       in your link script.  (This STACK is not the same as</B>
        <B>       the one in your CONFIG.SYS file.</B>

        <B>       ing lines to your link script (using Blinker for this</B>
        <B>       example:</B>

                  STACK 10240

                  BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH 100

        <B>      After relinking, delete and rebuild all your index files.</B>
