  <B>Getting Started:</B>

  Here are a few tips to help get you started with the SIx 3.0 quickly and
  easily:

    <U>.</U>  <B>Read this entire "Getting Started" section.</B>  It contains all of
       the information you need to know in order to integrate the SIx Driver
       into your new or existing applications.

    <U>.</U>  <B>Scan over the "Commonly Asked Questions" section.</B>  It contains the
       most common questions our technical support staff answers regarding
       the SIx Driver.  If you ever run into a problem with the SIx Driver,
       this is the first place to look for an answer.

    <U>.</U>  <B>Build and run the SIXDEMO program.</B>  All of files that make up the
       SIXDEMO program are contained in the subdirectory where the sample
       programs were installed.  By default this would be \SIX3\SAMPLES\.
       The MAKEDEMO.BAT file will build the SIXDEMO program for the SIXCDX
       or SIXNSX flavor, using either Blinker, CauseWay, or ExoSpace.

        <B>NOTE:  If you are linking with the RTLink that comes bundled</B>
        <B>       with Clipper 5.2</B>, you will not be able to build it with the
               MAKEDEMO.BAT file. Since that version of RTLink does not
               support the overlaying of C/ASM code (which is what the SIx
               Driver is written in), all of the SIx Driver's code would be
               in the root of the EXE file. This would severely impact the
               amount of free memory.  This may cause the program to run
               extremely slowly, lockup while running, or simply not execute
               at all, depending on the amount of free memory on your PC.

    <U>.</U>  <B>If you are using the International releases of CA-Clipper and SIx 3.0,</B>
       read the <U>"Notes For International Users"</U> section for important
       information on linking your application.

    <U>.</U>  <B>If you were previously using SIx Driver v2.0</B>, read the <U>"Moving From</U>
       <U>SIx 2.0 to SIx 3.0"</U> section.
