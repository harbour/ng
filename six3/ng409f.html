  <B>hs_Close():</B>

  Purpose:  Closes a previously opened HiPer-SEEK index file.  Releases
            allocated buffer space.

   Syntax:  hs_Close( &lt;hIndex&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;hIndex&gt; is an integer handle of a HiPer-SEEK index file.

     Note:  There is no length limit to the index string, however, strings
            of length of less than 4000 characters usually provide the
            best results.  Strings longer than this can result in higher
            alias rates and sometimes in unsatisfactory performance.  It
            is often worthwhile to experiment with the SIZE FACTOR
            parameter of hs_Create() in order to optimize performance.

  Returns:  1 if successful or a negative integer indicating an error.

  Errors Returned:

      -4 (BADSEEK) Error while attempting seek during buffer flushing.
      -6 (BADWRITE) Error while attempting write during buffer flush.
     -16 (BADPARMS) Invalid parameters were passed to the function.

  Comments:

    1.  All open HiPer-SEEK index files must be closed by hs_Close() prior to
    program termination. hs_Close() is responsible for buffer flushing and
    other chores necessary to properly update a HiPer-SEEK index.


  Example:

    USE test EXCL

    h := hs_Open( "LOOKUP.HSX", 10, 1 )
    hs_Set( h, "Thompson" )
    nRec := hs_Next( h )

    nVal := <B>hs_Close( h )</B>
    IF nVal != 1
      ? "Error closing HiPer-SEEK index!"
    ENDIF

    dbGoTo( nRec )
