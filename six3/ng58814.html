  <B>SIX???/1024   Append Lock Failed</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>A new record could not be appended because a lock could not
             be obtained for the new record.

  <B>Solution:  </B>For a shared work area, the APPEND BLANK command
             automatically obtains a record lock for the newly appended
             record.  If the record cannot be locked, the APPEND fails.  This
             generally occurs because another process has obtained a file
             lock on the database (.DBF) file.  Change the program to handle
             the lock contention.
