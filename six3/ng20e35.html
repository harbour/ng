  <B>Sx_BLOB2File():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_BLOB2File( &lt;cFileName&gt;, &lt;cFldName&gt; )

       cFileName = The name of the file to be retrieved from the .FPT/.SMT
                   memo and created.  If a file of this name already exists
                   on the current or specified drive, it will be overwritten.

        cFldName = The name of the .FPT/.SMT memo field retrieve the file
                   from.

  Returns:   Logical.  TRUE (.T.) if successful, FALSE (.F.) if not.

  Description:   Sx_BLOB2File() will write the contents of an .FPT/.SMT memo
                 field out to a file.  If the contents of the memo field is a
                 file that was previously stored with Sx_File2BLOB(), any
                 required decompression or encryption will be performed
                 automatically.

                 The term "BLOB" is an acronym for <B>B</B>inary <B>L</B>arge <B>OB</B>ject,
                 which means basically any type of binary data, not just
                 plain ASCII text that would normally be associated with
                 memo fields.

    NOTE:  This function is NOT supported under SIXNTX.

  Examples:

    USE test VIA "SIXCDX"  // Open TEST.DBF and TEST.FPT

    // Extract the IMAGE.PCX file from the NOTES field, writing it to disk
    <B>Sx_BLOB2File( "IMAGE.PCX", "NOTES" )</B>
