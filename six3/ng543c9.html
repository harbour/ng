  <B>TOTAL:</B>

  Syntax:

  <B>TOTAL ON &lt;expKey&gt; [FIELDS &lt;idField list&gt;] TO &lt;xcDatabase&gt; </B>
  <B>         [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;] [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
  <B>         [NOOPTIMIZE]</B>

  <B>ON &lt;expKey&gt;</B> defines the group of records that produce a new record in
  the target database file.  To make the summarizing operation accurate,
  the source database file should be INDEXed or SORTed on this expression.

  <B>FIELDS &lt;idField list&gt;</B> specifies the list of numeric fields to TOTAL.
  If the FIELDS clause is not specified, no numeric fields are totalled.
  Instead each numeric field in the target file contains the value for
  the first record matching the key expression.

  <B>TO &lt;xcDatabase&gt;</B> is the name of the target file to copy the summarized
  records to.  This argument may be specified either as a literal filename
  or as a character expression enclosed in parentheses. Unless otherwise
  specified, TOTAL assumes a (.DBF) extension.

  <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to TOTAL.  The
  default is ALL records.  Mach SIx only supports the ALL scope.

  <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the condition
  from the current record until the condition fails.  Mach SIx does not
  support the WHILE condition.

  <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records to TOTAL
  within the given scope.  Mach SIx will optimize any condition that
  contains one or more active index keys.

  <B>NOOPTIMIZE</B>, preempts optimization and forces default Clipper processing.

  <B>Description:</B>

  TOTAL is a database command that sequentially processes the current
  database file summarizing records by the specified key value and copying
  them to a new database file.  TOTAL works by first copying the structure
  of the current database file to &lt;xcDatabase&gt; except for memo fields.  It
  then sequentially scans the current database file within the specified
  scope of records.  As each record with a unique &lt;expKey&gt; value is
  encountered, that record is copied to the new database file.  The values
  of numeric fields specified in &lt;idField list&gt; from successive records with
  the same &lt;expKey&gt; value are added to fields with the same names in
  &lt;xcDatabase&gt;.  Summarization proceeds until a record with a new key value
  is encountered.  The process is then repeated for this record.

  Since TOTAL processes the source database file sequentially, it must be
  INDEXed or SORTed in &lt;expKey&gt; order for the summarization to be correct.

  To successfully TOTAL numeric fields, the source numeric fields must be
  large enough to hold the largest total possible for that numeric field.
  If not, a runtime error is generated.

  The TOTAL command may be optimized by specifying one or more active index
  keys in the FOR condition.  Note that Mach SIx will only optimize a TOTAL
  with a FOR condition and a scope of ALL.  WHILE conditions and alternate
  scopes cannot be optimized by Mach SIx.

  <B>Notes:</B>

  Deleted source records: Deleted source records are TOTALed unless SET
  DELETED is ON.  The deleted status of records, however, is not copied
  to the new database file.

  <B>Performance Tip:</B>

  When optimizing the TOTAL command Mach SIx must create a temporary index
  file to sort the resulting collection of data in the controlling index
  order.  To speed index creation, set the path for temporary files to local
  hard disk or ram drive. The temporary file path may be set with either the
  environment variable M6TEMP, or by calling the m6_SetTemp() function with
  the path as the parameter.
