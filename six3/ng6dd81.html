  <B>HiPer-SEEK Overview:</B>

  HiPer-SEEK is a relatively simple, yet powerful, system which uses Index
  Applications' Fast Text Search technology.  Married to the Mach SIx query
  optimizer, it provides unmatched power for high speed searches and
  filters.

  The HiPer-SEEK system is a set of functions which create and maintain a
  proprietary index file(s) enabling the rapid search of textual data from
  within Clipper compiled applications.  The HiPer-SEEK functions can be
  used to index and search any character based information the application
  can access.

  Data for a HiPer-SEEK index usually consist of selected fields of .DBF
  records. For example, you might want to be able to find people in a
  customer database. HiPer-SEEK could build an index based on the contents
  of the first name, last name, address, city, state and zipcode fields.
  You would then be able to find individual records by specifying character
  strings which occur anywhere in any of these fields.

  Given "john," HiPer-SEEK would identify records for John Smith, Elton
  John, 345 John White Avenue, and Johnson City. Additionally, the
  application might limit matches to those containing "john" in a
  particular field or in a particular position within a field. Searches can
  be very general or very specific. The speed of HiPer-SEEK makes all sorts
  of these additional operations possible.

  Another example is a parts inventory/order system. Part numbers are found
  by searching on a description field. Part No. WS-740283-B, described in
  an 80 character field as" Windshield bracket, right side for model year
  1983" is found by searching for "right windshield 83" or "brack
  windshield." HiPer-SEEK lets you specify almost any combination of words,
  partial words, numeric characters and phrases. Word order can be
  considered or not, as can case sensitivity.

  The default index extension for HiPer-SEEK indexes is .HSX, although, as
  with any other index file types, you can make it what you want when you
  create it.

  One of the new functions, hs_Filter(), is especially unique.  It combines
  the CFTS technology with our Mach SIx query optimizer to allow you to
  create extremely high speed filters on substrings within fields, text
  within memos, and other typically non-indexable (or non-SEEKable) values.
  For example, in a standard index built on LAST+FIRST, you can't find John
  Smith by doing a SEEK on "John", since it's not at the fron of the index.
  Thus, Mach SIx would have previously been unable to optimize a filter
  looking for "John" by using that index.  With the marriage of CFTS and
  Mach SIx this, and many other possibilities, are now possible.

  Compile, link, and run the HSFILT.PRG to see a quick example of this in
  action.  A TEST.DBF file must be created using DBCRE8.EXE for the
  HSFILT.EXE program to use.  For best impact, use a good number of records
  (at least 10000 or more).


  <B>Note For Current CFTS Users:</B>

  If you currently use CFTS, you no longer need to include the CFTS5.LIB
  file when you link.  The SIX3.LIB file is all that's needed.

  The internal CFTS function names remain unchanged, and can still be used
  in your applications that previously used CFTS5.LIB.  However, we have
  provided special surface functions (hs_*) which we will document and
  support.
