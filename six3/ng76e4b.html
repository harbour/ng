  <B>NOMEMO.OBJ</B>

  If your application does not use memo fields at all, or if you use an
  alternate memo support RDD (e.g. FlexFile), you can save memory by linking
  in the NOMEMO.OBJ file.  It will "stub" out all of the SIx Driver's normal
  memo support code.

  For example, to link a SIXNSX application called MYAPP that does not use
  .DBT, .FPT, or .SMT memo files at all, you would use the following link
  command:

    RTLink:

      <B>EXOSPACE FI myapp,sixnsx,nomemo LIB six3,clipper</B>

    Blinker:

      <B>BLINKER FI myapp,sixnsx,nomemo @six3 LIB clipper</B>

    CauseWay:

      <B>WL32 myapp sixnsx nomemo,,,six3 clipper</B>


  <B>NOTE:  This .OBJ file affects ALL SIx Driver workareas in the application.</B>
  <B>       if you have some databases with memo files and some without, do NOT</B>
  <B>       link in the .OBJ file in an effort to "reduce memory in those work-</B>
  <B>       areas that don't have memo fields."  It doesn't work like that.  It</B>
  <B>       is an "All or Nothing" choice.</B>
