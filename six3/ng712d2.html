  <B>HiPer-SEEK Searches:</B>

  Searches are done by three functions: hs_Set(), hs_Next() and
  hs_Verify().  hs_Set() receives the handle (identifier) for the
  appropriate index file and the character string(s) to be searched for.
  hs_Set() prepares the index file for a search and will return a 1 if
  successful.

  hs_Next() is then called and will return a number representing the first
  index record containing all the signatures of the search string(s). It
  will return the number of the next matching index record each time it is
  called until no more are found. A return value of zero indicates no
  further records match. The return of a negative number indicates an error
  condition. This is true of all HiPer-SEEK functions.

  A program will usually take each return for hs_Next() and verify that the
  search string does in fact occur in that record. This verification can
  take place as each hs_Next() return is made or these returns can be
  stored and the verification done as a batch operation.
