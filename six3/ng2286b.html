  <B>Sx_dbCreate():</B>

  Syntax:   Sx_dbCreate( &lt;cFile&gt;, &lt;aStru&gt; )

            cFile = Name of database file to create.
            aStru = Multi-dimensional array defining the database structure.

  Returns:  NIL

  Description:

    Sx_dbCreate() behaves, for the most part, the same as Clipper's own
    dbCreate() function.  However, it adds a few enhancements that make
    using SIx 3.0 new "V" field-types easier to code.

    Sx_dbCreate() automatically adds six to the length of weakly-typed "V"
    fields, and supports entering strongly-typed "V" field types of "I,4"
    and "D,3", automatically translating them to "V,4" and "V,3",
    respectively.

    One of the primary reasons for this function is to support SIx 3.0's
    three-byte packed DATE values.  Clipper's dbCreate() function will not
    accept a "D" field of anything other than 8 bytes long.  You <B>can</B>
    pass dbCreate() a "V" field of three bytes, which is interpreted by
    SIx 3.0 as a packed DATE value anyway.  However, to make it simpler on
    the eyes to code, Sx_dbCreate() supports defining packed DATE values
    as a "D" type with a length of three bytes.

  Example:  // The following two function calls have the same result

            dbCreate( "TEST", {{ "LAST"    , "V", 16, 0},;
                               { "FIRST"   , "V", 16, 0},;
                               { "SALARY"  , "V",  4, 0},;
                               { "HIREDATE", "V",  3, 0},;
                               { "NOTES"   , "V",  6, 0}} )

         <B>Sx_dbCreate( "TEST", {{ "LAST"    , "V", 10, 0},;</B>
         <B>                      { "FIRST"   , "V", 10, 0},;</B>
         <B>                      { "SALARY"  , "I",  4, 0},;</B>
         <B>                      { "HIREDATE", "D",  3, 0},;</B>
         <B>                      { "NOTES"   , "V",  0, 0}} )</B>
