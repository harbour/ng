  <B>Why can't I lock more than 20 records at a time?:</B>

  You probably won't experience this problem if you are locking records on a
  network drive.  However, on a local hard drive, with SHARE.EXE loaded, you
  may notice that Sx_IsLocked() starts returning FALSE after the 20th record
  has been locked with Sx_RLock().  The answer to this problem is simple.

  By default, SHARE.EXE allows up to 20 <B>files</B> to be locked at one time.
  Apparently, SHARE also counts record locks in the same way that it counts
  file locks.  If you load share using the <B>/l</B> switch, you can set it for the
  desired amount of record locks that you need.

  For example, the following line, when executed at the DOS prompt, would
  allow you to lock up to 50 records on a local hard drive:

    <B>SHARE /l:50</B>
