  <B>The OTTO Utility:</B>

  The OTTO utility is a tool that can assist you in converting your
  existing database file structures to use SIx 3.0's new "V" field types,
  for more efficient data storage.

  To create the OTTO.EXE utility, change to the directory where the SIx 3.0
  sample files were installed.  By default, this would be \SIX3\SAMPLES.
  Insure that the SIx 3.0 .LIB, .OBJ, and .CH files are in the current
  directory or in the required DOS environment paths, then just run the
  included MAKEOTTO.BAT file.  This will call Blinker to link the files
  required to create OTTO.EXE.

   <B>NOTE: If you are using ExoSpace or CauseWay instead of Blinker, just   </B>
   <B>      edit the MAKEOTTO.BAT file to call your linker instead of        </B>
   <B>      BLINKER.EXE.                                                     </B>
   <B>                                                                       </B>
   <B>      The RTLink that comes with CA-Clipper is not recommended for     </B>
   <B>      building the OTTO utility as OTTO pulls in a good majority of the</B>
   <B>      SIx 3.0 library.  The Clipper-included RTLink does not have the  </B>
   <B>      ability to overlay any of this code, thus low memory problems are</B>
   <B>      bound to occur.                                                  </B>
   <B>                                                                       </B>
   <B>      If you only have RTLink available, you can download a pre-built  </B>
   <B>      version of OTTO.EXE from our in-house BBS or from our CompuServe </B>
   <B>      section (GO SWARE, LIB 3).                                       </B>

  To use OTTO.EXE, just run it with either no command-line arguments, or
  you can optionally pass it the name of the database file to be converted.
  If you do not specify the file name at the command line, OTTO will
  display a scrolling picklist of the .DBF files in the current directory
  to choose from.

  Once OTTO knows which file is to be converted, it displays the old
  structure alongside the new structure.  By default:

    <B>.</B> All CHARACTER fields greater than 16 characters are defaulted to 10
      byte "V" fields.  However, for short CHARACTER fields, or those whose
      data is always a fixed length, you may want to change them back to
      "C" types instead of using "V" types.

    <B>.</B> All MEMO fields are defaulted to 0 byte "V" fields.

    <B>.</B> All NUMERIC fields greater than four bytes long and less than 11 bytes
      long are converted to four byte "I" (long integer) fields.

    <B>.</B> All 8 byte DATE fields are converted to 3 byte DATE fields.

    <B>.</B> Any fields which cannot (or should not) be modified will be greyed
      out, and cannot be edited at all.

  You can edit any of the other default settings for the destination file
  structure by highlighting the field to edit with the cursor keys and
  pressing &lt;Enter&gt;.  Follow the instructions in the message box at the
  bottom of the screen.

  Once you have defined your destination file's structure, press F10.  OTTO
  will convert the data file to the new structure, renaming the old data
  file(s) to have a "K" at the end of the file extension.  For example, an
  old TEST.DBF and TEST.FPT would become TEST.DBK and TEST.FPK.

  When converting a database with a .DBT memo file, the old memo file name
  is not changed, since .DBT's do not support VariField data, the new file
  would have to be an .FPT or .SMT memo file.  Also, adding a "K" to the
  end of an old TEST.DBF and TEST.DBT would have resulted in two TEST.DBK
  files.  Not good.

   <B>WARNING: After modifying the structure of your database with OTTO, you</B>
   <B>         should rebuild ALL index files.  Failing to do so may result</B>
   <B>         in index corruption errors when performing a REPLACE operations.</B>
