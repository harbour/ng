  <B>SIX???/633  Index Locked</B>

  <B>Problem:   </B>A shared index has been locked by another user.

  <B>Solution:  </B>This generally occurs when one user is creating a new tag
             for a shared .CDX/.NSX file.  This operation locks the entire
             index until the new tag has been created.  Change the program
             to handle the lock contention or prevent new tags from being
             created in a shared index.
