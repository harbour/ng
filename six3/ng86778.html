  <B>Mach SIx says my query is optimizable, why is it still slow?:</B>

  Keep in mind that Mach SIx achieves performance over conventional query
  methods by narrowing down the records that must be tested in the database
  to satisfy the query, by searching the index files first.  If the indexed
  portion of the query has not effectively reduced the number of target
  records to a small percentage of the source table, gains in query
  performance will be marginal at best.  Remember to target the smallest
  possible set of records with the indexed portion of your queries.  This
  way maximum efficiency will be obtained.  For more tips on increasing
  performance see the section <B>Performance Tips</B> in the <B>Using Mach SIx</B>
  section of this guide.
