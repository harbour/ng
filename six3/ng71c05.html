  It is important to note that even with a verify process the HiPer-SEEK
  subroutines have been designed to retrieve records very quickly. In fact,
  a large variety of post-search operations can be completed in less time
  than it would take to do a conventional sequential search.  Another
  verification type that might be created is a proximity search for two
  strings within text records. After a text record passes a hs_Verify()
  type 3 verification confirming the presence of both strings, the number
  of characters between search strings could be counted and compared to a
  user established maximum.

  HiPer-SEEK does not contain a Previous function. This feature can be
  implemented by saving the results of a search; that is, saving the
  numbers returned by hs_Next() and verified by hs_Verify() in an array, a
  temporary file, or a subindex or by copying the actual records to a new
  .DBF file.

  In a somewhat similar way, logical OR and NOT type searches can be made.
  In the case of OR, the saved results of a search for a particular
  string(s) would be combined with the results of another search. The
  resulting list of numbers, after eliminating duplicates, would represent
  all text records containing either of the two strings.

  The NOT case can be implemented using the verify process. First use
  hs_Set(), hs_Next() and hs_Verify() to find records containing the first
  term. then search each of these records, again using hs_Verify(), for the
  occurrence of the second, unwanted term, rejecting those records
  containing it.

  It is also possible, using hs_Verify(), to limit a search to a portion of
  a text record. For example, if an .HSX index was built based on all
  fields of a data file, you can limit a search to a particular field by
  supplying only that field to hs_Verify() rather than supplying the entire
  source text record. Only records containing the search string(s) in that
  field will pass the verification.

  Searches can be limited to a range of records by testing the return
  values of hs_Next() against a desired range of record numbers. For
  example, if you were to build an application based on the text of the
  Bible, you might want to limit a search to a particular book. By knowing
  that the Book of John was made up of records 300 through 400, you could
  ignore any hs_Next() return value outside of that range. It would be
  important to exclude these values before the verification stage. In fact,
  you should always attempt to reduce the number of records needing
  verification.
