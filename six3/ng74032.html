  <B>Memo Fields:</B>

  Clipper's memo fields are intended to provide an easy and flexible method
  for storing large amounts of free-form text. While Clipper supplies many
  useful functions for managing memo fields, it does not provide any simple
  or fast mechanism to search their contents. This weakness limits the full
  potential of memo fields by making the job of finding words and phrases
  stored in memo fields difficult and slow.

  Use HiPer-SEEK to plug this gap in Clipper's search tools by treating the
  contents of a memo field as just another string of text, no different
  from that stored in any other character field.  Keep in mind that
  HiPer-SEEK works best with strings less than 4000 characters long. With
  strings of this size, we recommend you use the largest SIZE FACTOR (3)
  when creating the original HiPer-SEEK index. See the sections discussing
  hs_Create().
