  <B>hs_Open():</B>

  Purpose:  This function is used to open an existing HiPer-SEEK index file.

   Syntax:  hs_Open( &lt;cExpr&gt;, &lt;nVal1&gt;, &lt;nVal2&gt; )

    Where:  &lt;cExpr&gt; a string representing a file path name. It may contain
              drive and subdirectory information.

            &lt;nVal1&gt; is an integer which will be multiplied by 1024 to
              determine how much buffer space is to be used by the HiPer-SEEK
              routines for this index. For example, a value of 20 will
              allocate 20k or 20480 bytes of buffer space plus a small amount
              of overhead. See the comments section for hs_Create() for how
              to use this number most wisely. The minimum size is 1.

              Performance will improve greatly if the entire index file will
              fit into this buffer. If not, some experimentation will be
              helpful in determining the best size. In network operation this
              buffer is automatically set to the minimum size.

              The memory buffer size is less critical in the newer more
              powerful computers where fast fixed disks and extensive disk
              caching are common. Some experimentation will help chose the
              proper settings for any particular application and environment.

            &lt;nVal2&gt; is an integer expression indicating the read-write and
              sharing modes for the file. A HiPer-SEEK index can be opened
              read-write or read-only and EXCLUSIVE or SHARED. The EXCLUSIVE
              and SHARED modes follow Clipper's use of the terms. When an
              index is opened read-write, the application can read existing
              index records and write new ones to the file. When the file is
              opened read-only, the application can only read records from
              the index.  This mode is useful with CD-ROM applications or
              with applications that must prevent users from inadvertently
              updating an existing index.

              The values to use are:

                  0 READ-WRITE + SHARED
                  1 READ-WRITE + EXCLUSIVE
                  2 READ-ONLY + SHARED
                  3 READ-ONLY + EXCLUSIVE


  Returns:  An integer HiPer-SEEK index handle (0 through 63) if successful,
            else returns a negative integer indicating an error (see below).
            The hs_Create(), hs_Index(), and hs_Open() return a 'HANDLE' to
            the calling program.  You must save the handle returned by these
            functions for use with the remaining HiPer-SEEK functions. The
            value of a HiPer-SEEK handle is only meaningful to other
            HiPer-SEEK func- tions. Although you may inspect the value of the
            handle, its value is arbitrary and of no significance except to
            other HiPer- SEEK functions. Under no circumstances should your
            application ever change the value of a HiPer-SEEK handle.

  Errors Returned:

      -2 (MEMERR) System was unable to allocate the memory requested.  Try
         again with a smaller value of &lt;nVal&gt;.
      -5 (BADREAD) System generated a read error while reading the index file
         header.  This error is associated with trying to open a file that is
         already open.
     -10 (OPENERR)  Open failure.  System was unable to open the file
         specified by &lt;cExpr&gt;. Insure that the file does exist and it is not
         read protected.
     -16 (BADPARMS)  Invalid parameters were passed to the function.
     -17 (NOMOREHANDLES) Ran out of HiPer-SEEK handles.
     -20 (LOCKFAILED) Unable to lock file.
     -21 (NOMORELOCKS) Lock table exhausted.
     -22 (CANNOTUNLOCK) Unable to unlock file.

  Comments:

    <B>Network Operation:</B>

    The hs_Open() mode parameter is patterned after Clipper's Net_Use()
    function.  Whenever a new HiPer-SEEK index file is created it is always
    created in EXCLUSIVE mode. If an application needs to create an index and
    then use it in SHARED mode, it must create the index using hs_Create(),
    then close the index, and use hs_Open() to reopen the file with the
    SHARING mode on.

    Note that hs_Index() does require a mode parameter. This is because
    once the function creates and builds a new index, it closes the index
    and then reopens it in the desired mode.

    It is possible, on some systems, to get a -20, LOCKFAILED error. If
    hs_Open() cannot lock the file, after trying three times, it will
    return the -20 error. You can insert code to trap the -20 and force the
    program to try again. This will prove satisfactory in most cases.

    <B>How HiPer-SEEK Works on a Local Area Network:</B>

    When an application tries to open an index in SHARED mode, hs_Open()
    tests for the presence of support for file locking and adjusts its
    behavior accordingly. Assuming that you are on a network and you open
    your HiPer-SEEK index in SHARED mode, HiPer-SEEK automatically institutes
    a system of locks while keeping its buffers flushed. In the event that
    you attempt open a HiPer-SEEK index in SHARED mode on a machine that does
    not support file and record locking, HiPer-SEEK does not try to lock
    files and it manages its buffers in the same way that using a "1" open
    mode would.  (The READ-ONLY open-mode does not change the way HiPer-SEEK
    handles its internal buffers when running in SHARED mode. That is, the
    memory buffer is set to 1K.)


  Example:

    USE test EXCL

    h := <B>hs_Open( "LOOKUP.HSX", 16, 1 )</B>
    IF h &lt; 0
      ? "Error opening HiPer-SEEK index!"
    ENDIF
