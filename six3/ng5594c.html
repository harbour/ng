  <B>WILDSEEK:</B>

  The <B>WILDSEEK</B> command functions similarly to the standard Clipper <B>SEEK</B>
  command.  However, as its name implies, you can perform wildcard SEEKs with
  WILDSEEK.  Simply substitute a question mark <B>(?)</B> or an asterisk <B>(*)</B> in
  place of the portion to contain the wildcard portion of the search string.

  For example, to find the first person in your CUSTOMER database whose
  name is either Smith or Smyth, you could do this:

       USE CUSTOMER             // Open CUSTOMER.DBF
       SET TAG TO LASTNAME      // Select LASTNAME Tag
       <B>WILDSEEK "Sm?th"</B>         // or WILDSEEK "Sm*th"
       WHILE found()            // Got at least one!
         ? LAST + ", " + FIRST  // Display customer name
         WILDSEEKNEXT "Sm?th"   // Look for next match
       ENDDO


  As with the standard <B>SEEK</B> command, Clipper's <B>found()</B> function will let
  you know if <B>WILDSEEK</B> successfully found a matching record.

  You can also perform WILDSEEKs where the wildcard character at the
  beginning of the search string (i.e.; <B>WILDSEEK "*son"</B>).  However, keep
  in mind that since WILDSEEK has no idea what the first letter might be, it
  must start at the top of the database and SKIP through each record looking
  for a match.  This can take just as long as using Clipper's standard
  <B>LOCATE</B> command.

    NOTE:  This command is NOT supported under SIXNTX.
