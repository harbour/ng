  <B>What is a .CDX?:</B>

  A .CDX file is a Compound Index - an index file which contains multiple
  indexes (called <B>tags</B>).  Compound indexes allow you to have several indexes
  available to your application while only using one file handle.  Once a
  compound index is opened, all the tags contained in the file are auto-
  matically updated as the records are changed.

  The first tag in the compound index (in order of creation) is by default
  the active tag when the index is opened.  The exception to this rule is if
  the .CDX file is a "structural" index, in that it has the same base name
  as its associated .DBF file.  If this is the case, the .CDX file is opened
  automatically when the .DBF is USEd, but no tag is selected (ORDER is 0).

  You can have several compound indexes for a single database file, giving
  you the ability to go well beyond Clipper's normal 15 index limit.  A
  compound index can have as many as 99 tags, but the practical limit is
  around 50.
