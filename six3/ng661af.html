  <B>Sub-Indexes:</B>

  Sub-indexes are indexes that are built based upon another index, usually
  a conditional index.  Instead of plowing through the entire database, a
  sub-index includes only the records that are contained in the index upon
  which it is based.  This adds up to substantial time savings when all you
  want is to re-arrange the a conditional index.

  Sub-indexes are created with the INDEX command using the <B>SUBINDEX</B> keyword
  at the end of an <B>INDEX ON</B> command, or by just using the <B>SUBINDEX</B> command.
  This tells the SIx Driver to use the current index to build the
  new one.

  Note that sub-indexes do NOT inherit the condition from the original index.

  <B>NOTE: Sub-Indexes are considered non-updatable and are normally intended</B>
  <B>      to be used as temporary indexes.  What this means is, if you change</B>
  <B>      keys values in your database after creating or opening a SUBINDEX,</B>
  <B>      the keys in the SUBINDEX will not change.  If you want to force a</B>
  <B>      SUBINDEX to be updatable, you can do so by also making it a condi-</B>
  <B>      tional index by using a FOR clause.</B>
