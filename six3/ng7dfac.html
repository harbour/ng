  <B>How do I use the SIx Driver with an existing application?:</B>

  Getting started with the SIx Driver is simple.  The following steps will
  get you up and running with your current application:

    <B>NOTE:  The text below uses the SIXNSX flavor of the SIx Driver for the</B>
    <B>       examples.  If you are using the SIXCDX or SIXNTX flavor instead,</B>
    <B>       simply substitute the appropriate RDD name instead of "SIXNSX".</B>


  <B>1. Add the appropriate SIx Driver header file to each source code file</B>
  <B>   where database support is required.</B>  For example:

         <U>#include "SIXNSX.CH"</U>


  <B>2. Make sure index extensions aren't hard-coded in your application.</B>

     The default extension for SIx Driver indexes under SIXNSX is .NSX.
     Under the SIXCDX flavor, the default index extension is .IDX.  As
     with CA-Clipper's DBFNTX driver, our SIXNTX driver also uses the .NTX
     index extension and format.

     The best way to determine index extensions from within an application
     is to call Clipper's OrdBagExt() function.

     For example, if you use the following code to determine the existence
     of an index file:

          <B>IF !file("INDEX.NTX")</B>
            <B>INDEX ON field TO index</B>
          <B>ENDIF</B>

     you should change the code to use Clipper's OrdBagExt() function
     instead, as follows:

          <B>IF !file( "INDEX" + OrdBagExt() )</B>
            <B>INDEX ON field TO index</B>
          <B>ENDIF</B>


      <U>NOTE: Under Clipper 5.01a, the OrdBagExt() function was known as</U>
      <U>      IndexExt().</U>


  <B>3. Add SIXNSX.OBJ to your link command or link script.</B>  This will make
     the SIx Driver's SIXNSX flavor the default RDD.  (Place SIXNSX.OBJ
     <B>after</B> your main application files.)

  <B>4. If your application uses memo fields</B>, add <B>DBT.OBJ</B> to your link command
     or link script to add .DBT support until you get a chance to convert
     your .DBT's to .SMT/.FPT's (optional).  Converting .DBT memo files to
     .SMT/.FPT's is covered elsewhere in this section.

  <B>5. Add SIX3.LIB as a library to your link command or link script.</B>  If you
     are using Blinker, you can overlay most of the SIX3.LIB file simply by
     specifying the SIX3.LNK link script, like this:

        <B>BLINKER FI myapp,sixnsx,dbt</B> <U>@six3</U> <B>LIB clipper</B>

  That's it!  You've converted your application to use the SIx Driver's
  high-performance index format.  Now you can start to make use of the SIx
  Drivers extended features, such as compound indexes, index scoping,
  roll-your-own indexes, ...
