  <B>Using VariField 'V' Field Types:</B>

  Under SIx 2.0 the term <B>VariField</B> refers primarily to ability to store
  and retrieve variable data types into a MEMO field.  For  example, an
  array stored in MEMO field would return "A" from Clipper's ValType()
  function.

  In SIx 3.0, a new field type -- 'V' -- has been added.  There are
  <B>weakly-typed</B> and <B>strongly-typed</B> VariFields.

  Depending on the structure and content on your particular database
  file(s), it's possible to cut the size of your data files in half using
  "V" fields.  The <B>OTTO.EXE</B> utility can assist you in converting your
  existing database files to store data more efficiently using 'V' fields.
