  <B>Order Aliasing:</B>

  "Order aliasing" provides a means for you to specify exactly what
  indexes are used to optimize a query.  This is especially useful when
  you want to optimize a query using multiple Roll-Your-Own or any of
  the other non-standard indexes ( conditional, subindex, and unique ).

  In previous versions of MachSIx your were restricted to using only one
  non-standard index at time and it had to be selected when the query
  was executed.   This restriction still exists but can now be worked-
  around using "order aliasing".

  The reasoning behind this restriction is that these type of indexes do
  not represent the entire data set thus MachSIx cannot indiscriminately
  choose between one of these indexes to resolve a query.  But now you
  can decide what indexes are eligible on a query by query basis.

  To use "order aliasing" simply replace the field portion of your
  simple expression with the index order name aliased by the special
  MachSIx alias, <B>_ORDER</B>.   The following example demonstrates two calls
  to m6_IsOptimize(); the first with the query condition specified in
  the conventional manner and the second using "order aliasing".

     #define RDDNAME "SIXCDX"

     //...............................................use accounts
     USE Account VIA RDDNAME

     //................................................create index
     INDEX ON State TO Temp

     //................................conventional query statement
     ? m6_IsOptimize( 'State = "CA"' )                        // 2

     //..................................query via "order aliasing"
     ? <B>m6_IsOptimize( '_ORDER-&gt;Temp = "CA"' )</B>                 // 2

  In the next example two RYO indexes are simultaneously used to look up
  all winter season boots currently in stock.

      #define RDDNAME  "SIXCDX"

      //..........................................use inventory file
      USE Inventory VIA RDDNAME

      //..................................open inventory query index
      SET INDEX TO InvQry

      //....... Assume that InvQry contains tags Season, and Descrip
      // INDEX ON Sx_Char(4)  TAG Season  OF InvQry
      // INDEX ON Sx_Char(15) TAG Descrip OF InvQry


      //.................................................Set filter
      <B>SET FILTER TO _ORDER-&gt;Season  = "WINT"   .AND. ;</B>
                    <B>_ORDER-&gt;Descrip = "BOOTS"  .AND. ;</B>
                    <B>!Empty( InStock )</B>

      //........................initialize filter, browse() results
      GO TOP
      Browse()


  Note that MachSIx will only match the first unique index name in the
  order list to the one specified after the _ORDER alias.  In the above
  example, if you opened a second index, say InvQry2 that contained its
  own Season and Descrip tags, only the first one in the order list
  would be used.
