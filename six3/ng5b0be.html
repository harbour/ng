  <B>SIX???/690  Cannot open structural index</B>

  <B>Problem:</B>  Two things usually cause this error:

             1.  The database file used to have a structural .CDX/.NSX file,
                 and it has been deleted.

             2.  Another user on the network has just built the .CDX/.NSX
                 file, and it still has a file lock active.


  <B>Solution:</B>  Respective to the problems listed above:

             1.  Rebuild the .CDX/.NSX file.

             2.  After creating a structural .CDX/.NSX file on a network,
                 you should close and reopen the database file to unlock
                 the newly-created .CDX/.NSX file.  This will allow other
                 network users to access the new index file.


  <B>NOTE:</B>  This is not a fatal error.  Of the three options you have when
         this error comes up, if you select QUIT, you'll drop to DOS.  If
         you select RETRY, it will try to open the .CDX/.NSX file again.  If
         you select DEFAULT, it will forget about trying to open the index
         file and will just open the database file without it.
