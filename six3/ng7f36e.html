  <B>How does the SIx Driver differ from the DBFCDX Driver in Clipper 5.2?:</B>

  While the SIx Driver's FoxPro flavor (SIXCDX) may seem very similar to
  the DBFCDX driver we licensed to CA for inclusion with Clipper 5.2x, there
  are some very major differences between the two.

  The DBFCDX Driver supplied with Clipper 5.2 basically provides what we
  call "The Three C's":

    <B>C</B>ompound:  Store up to 50 index "tags" within one compound (CDX) index

    <B>C</B>ompact Indexes:  The CDX and Compact IDX formats of FoxPro are
                      fully supported.

    <B>C</B>onditional Indexes:  INDEX ON &lt;cExp&gt; TO &lt;cFile&gt; FOR &lt;cCondition&gt;


  These are some of the current SIx Driver (SIXCDX) features which are <B>NOT</B>
  included in the Clipper 5.2 DBFCDX RDD:
