  <B>Why am I getting a "DBCMD/1015 Argument Error: DBUSEAREA"?:</B>

  The most common cause of this error is incorrect usage of the VIA clause.

    <B>USE &lt;.dbf&gt; VIA "&lt;rdd&gt;"</B>

  When using the VIA clause with the USE command, always make sure the RDD
  name is in "quotes" and spelled correctly.  To open a TEST.DBF using the
  SIx Driver's SIXCDX flavor, the correct syntax would be:

    <B>USE test VIA "SIXCDX"</B>

  Another possible cause for this error is attempting to use an RDD that
  has not been linked into your application.  The default RDD (normally
  DBFNTX, unless SIXCDX.OBJ, SIXNSX.OBJ, SIXMDX.OBJ, or SIXNTX.OBJ have been
  linked in) is automatically linked into your application.  All others must
  be explicitly declared with the REQUEST command.  The SIx Driver header
  files contain the correct REQUEST declaration for the SIx Driver flavor
  they belong to, and needs only to be #included in your source file(s).

  This is how the SIx Driver header files cause the SIx Driver (SIXCDX) to
  be linked into your application:

    <B>REQUEST SIXCDX</B>
