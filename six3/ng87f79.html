  <B>Individual (.IDX/.NTX) Indexes:</B>


  <U>SIXCDX .IDX Indexes:</U>

  The SIx Driver (SIXCDX) individual index files (.IDX's) are FoxPro 2
  compatible <B>compact</B> indexes.  This is the default index type when using
  the SIx Driver's SIXCDX flavor.

  SIx Driver .IDX key expressions will support any valid Clipper expression,
  including User-Defined Functions (UDF's), though extra care must be taken
  when using UDFs if compatibility with FoxPro 2 is anticipated.  Key expres-
  sions can be up to 256 bytes long, with a maximum key length of 240 bytes.

  Conditional indexes (indexes that only include records that satisfy a
  filter expression) can be created with the SIx Driver.  These conditional
  indexes are updated just like normal indexes, with records added to or
  dropped from the index based on the filter expression.  Condition expres-
  sions can be up to 256 bytes long and can be any valid Clipper expression
  (including UDF's) that evaluates to a logical value (.T. or .F.).

  <B>NOTES:</B>

    Key expressions and conditional expressions cannot contain LOCAL or
    STATIC variables, since these usually will not be in scope when the
    index is opened or updated.  If you absolutely can't find a way around
    using a variable in your key or conditional expression, then a PRIVATE
    variable must be used.

    Key expressions and conditional expressions are checked for validity
    when an index is created as well as when it is opened.


  <U>SIXNTX .NTX Indexes:</U>

  The .NTX files files supported under the SIx Driver's SIXNTX flavor are
  exactly the same format as standard Clipper (DBFNTX) indexes.  The same
  rules that apply to this index format under DBFNTX also apply under the
  SIXNTX driver.

  The primary advantage of using SIXNTX over DBFNTX is:

    <B>.</B> SIXNTX adds support for index SCOPEs, Data Enryption, Database Event
      Triggers, and other features not found in DBFNTX.

    <B>.</B> When needing to have .NTX support in the same application that also
      uses SIXCDX and/or SIXNSX indexes, using SIXNTX instead of DBFNTX
      will give you the lowest possible load size (most free memory).
