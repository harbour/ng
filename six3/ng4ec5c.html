  <B>SET INDEX:</B>

  Syntax

  <B>SET INDEX TO [&lt;xcIndex list&gt;] [ADDITIVE]</B>

  Arguments

     &lt;xcIndex list&gt; is a list of up to 15 index (.CDX, .IDX, .NSX, or .NTX)
     filenames, separated by commas.  Any reference to an index filename that
     results in either a null string ("") or spaces is ignored.  Each index
     file can be specified as a literal filename or as a character expression
     enclosed in parentheses.

     If an extension is not specified, the SIx Driver's SIXCDX flavor will
     first look for an .IDX file and, if one is not found, it will then look
     for a .CDX file.  The SIXNSX flavor looks for .NSX extensions by
     default.  SIXNTX, as with Clipper's DBFNTX driver, looks for .NTXs.

     The ADDITIVE clause tells the SIx Driver not to close any previously
     opened indexes before opening the new index.

     SET INDEX TO without an argument closes all indexes open in the current
     work area with the exception of a structural .CDX/.NSX.  Structural
     index files cannot be closed without closing their database file as
     well.  See the <B>"Commonly Asked Questions"</B> section for more on structural
     .CDX/.NSX index file behavior.


 Description

     When using the SIx Driver, SET INDEX closes all currently open index
     files (<B>except structural .CDX/.NSX's</B>), unless you have used the ADDITIVE
     clause, and then opens the specified index files in the current work
     area.  If the ADDITIVE clause was used, no previously opened indexes are
     closed before opening the new index.


 Examples

     USE TEST VIA "SIXCDX"
     <B>SET INDEX TO one, two, three</B>  // Opens ONE.IDX, TWO.IDX, and THREE.IDX
     .
     .  // Do some stuff...
     .
     <B>SET INDEX TO four ADDITIVE</B>    // Opens FOUR.IDX <B>without</B> closing the
                                   // other three indexes first.
     SET ORDER TO 2                // Selects TWO.IDX
