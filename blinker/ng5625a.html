 <B>1301: unable to load file &lt;filename&gt;</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the DOS extender was unable to load the
 specified file. This is most likely to be caused by the file having been
 overwritten or corrupted, possibly due to an aborted link while creating the
 file. Please attempt to reinstall or recreate the file concerned.

 It may also be caused by the current user having sufficient network access
 rights to open the file but insufficient rights to load and execute it.
