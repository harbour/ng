 <B>SEARCH                        Prioritize all symbols in specified libraries.</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Prioritize all symbols in the specified libraries.</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>SEARCH [d:][path]&lt;libname&gt; [, [d:][path]&lt;libname&gt; ...]</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>SEARCH C:\LIBS\MYLIB1, D:\ABC\LIB2</B></U>

 The SEARCH command is an alternative form of the LIBRARY command, but
 operates slightly differently.

 During the normal linking process, Blinker will make multiple passes over a
 given library until it is unable to resolve any further external references,
 at which point processing of the next library begins. If, after all
 libraries have been processed, there are still unresolved externals, Blinker
 will make another pass over the libraries and so on.

 When Blinker encounters a SEARCH command, it loads all the symbol names from
 the named library into a table in memory. This has the effect of causing any
 previous unresolved external references, and any future external references
 encountered to be resolved from the SEARCHed library (if they are defined
 there) in preference to a subsequent library.

 Use of the SEARCH command should be limited to those cases where it is
 required, as it slows the linking process, and uses large amounts of memory
 at link time.
