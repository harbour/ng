 <B>MEMORY                        Limit amount of memory allocated to program</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Limit the amount of memory allocated to the program</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>MEMORY &lt;nuLimit&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>1 MB</B></U>

 The MEMORY command is used to set the size, as a decimal number of
 paragraphs, of the largest memory block into which DOS will load the
 program.

 This command is used, amongst other things, to reduce the size of the near
 heap in Medium and Large model programs.

 There are three figures associated with the memory requirements of a DOS
 executable file:

    a) The physical image size of the root portion of the executable.
    b) The additional amount of memory required for uninitialised data.
    c) Additional memory requested by the program. This value is normally set
       to 1MB, causing DOS to allocate the largest available contiguous
       memory block to the program at load time.

 The figure represented by (a+b) is known as the load size, and is the amount
 of memory that DOS requires to load the program into memory.

 The MEMORY command specifies the total number of paragraphs to be allocated
 to the program (a+b+c), and must be at least as large as (a+b). If the
 amount of memory specified is LESS than (a+b), Blinker will automatically
 increase the MEMORY figure to the minimum value.
