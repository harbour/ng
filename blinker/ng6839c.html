 <B>Module Definition Files</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 <B>Overview</B>

 In addition to a free-format link script file to specify the .OBJ and .LIB
 files to be linked, Blinker uses a module definition file to provide extra
 information on the characteristics of a Windows .EXE. Since the Windows .EXE
 format is also used for DOS extended programs, many of the module definition
 file commands can also be used with DOS extended programs.

 The format and commands in module definition files are identical to those
 used by Microsoft LINK, TLINK etc, with one or two additions to extend their
 functionality.

 Blinker supports module definition files through the use of the

    <B>DEFFILE &lt;filename&gt;</B>

 link script command, with the default file type being .DEF.

 The DEFFILE command can be placed anywhere in the link script file, but it
 is suggested that it be placed at the end to ensure that options specified
 therein take priority over those in the link script file.

 Alternatively, to avoid maintaining two separate files, .DEF file commands
 may be included directly in the link script (.LNK) file between DEFBEGIN and
 DEFEND commands:

    <B>DEFBEGIN             // Begin .DEF commands</B>
    <B>...</B>
    <B>DEFEND               // End .DEF commands</B>

 Again these may be placed anywhere in the link script file, but it is
 suggested that they be placed at the end of the file.

 Blinker looks for module definition files in the following order:

    .  In the path specified with the file name
    .  In the current directory
    .  In the LIB environment variable paths

 For further information on module definition files beyond what is provided
 in this guide please see your compiler documentation.
