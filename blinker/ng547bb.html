 <B>1220: swap error [major/minor] (text message)</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that a fatal error has occurred in the Blinker swap
 system. The error consists of a major error number and an associated minor
 error number [major/minor] and a text message indicating the type of error
 that occurred.

 Normally such errors are reported through the swap function error functions
 SWPERRMAJ() and SWPERRMIN(), however, in the case that the program cannot be
 restored to memory, a 1220 error will be output, and the program will return
 to DOS.

 The following major error codes have the following meanings and text
 messages:

    0     No error

    1     Disk full

    2*    File not found

    3*    Disk I/O error

    4     Change directory error

    5     Temporary file creation error

    6     Change drive error

    7*    EMS error

    8*    XMS error

    9     SHELL error

    10    Handle table too large to save

    11+   Top of memory error

    12+   MCB chain corrupt

    13    Too many MCBs

    14*   DOS memory function call error

    15+   Unable to locate same segment

    16    Unable to find COMSPEC in environment

    254+  Swap internal error

    255+  Swap internal error

 Errors marked with a (+) are always fatal and will result in a 1220 error
 message. Errors marked with a (*) may result in a 1220 message, or may be
 non-fatal depending on when the error occurs in the swap process.

 Errors that are not marked with either (+) or (*) are non-fatal (and will
 not result in a 1220 message), but the child process will not have been
 executed. These errors can be detected through the SWPERRMAJ() and
 SWPERRMIN() functions (see Chapter 10).

 The explanation for each major error is as follows:

 <B>0 - No error</B>

 A major error of zero indicates that the swap function successfully restored
 the command interpreter, and restored the program image. Normally a minor
 error code of zero will be returned. In the case that the swap function had
 to remove a TSR from memory, however, the minor error code will be set to 1,
 purely for informational purposes.

 If the size of DOS memory increased during the swap (by executing a program
 such as Quarterdeck's VIDRAM) the minor error code returned will be 2. Users
 should be STRONGLY discouraged from executing such programs during the swap.
 Please note that a decrease in DOS memory through the use of such a utility
 will result in a fatal error (major code 11).

 <B>1 - Disk full</B>

 The disk on which the swap function was attempting to save the program image
 is full.

 The minor error code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>2 - File not found</B>

 DOS returned a 'file not found' error when the swap function attempted to
 restore the program image from a disk swap file. The swap file may have been
 deleted.

 The minor error code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>3 - Disk I/O error</B>

 DOS returned an unexpected error while the swap function was either reading
 from or writing to the disk file containing the program image.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>4 - Change directory error</B>

 The swap function encountered an error either when changing to the requested
 directory passed as a parameter to the swap function or when restoring the
 current directory following the swap.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>5 - Temporary file creation error</B>

 DOS returned an error when the swap function attempted to create a temporary
 file to restore the program image. Check that the path specified for the
 temporary file is valid.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>6 - Change drive error</B>

 The swap function encountered an error either when changing to the requested
 drive passed as a parameter to the swap function, or when restoring the
 current drive following the swap.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>7 - EMS error</B>

 An unexpected error occurred during an EMS operation.

 The minor code is the EMS function call that failed.

 <B>8 - XMS error</B>

 An unexpected error occurred during an XMS operation.

 The minor code is the XMS function call that failed.

 <B>9 - SHELL error</B>

 The swap function was unable to execute the command processor. Check that
 the COMSPEC environment variable was set to point to the command
 interpreter.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>10 - Handle table too large to save</B>

 The swap function can only save an expanded handle table that contains 255
 (or fewer) handles.

 The minor error code is the number of handles in the current handle table.

 <B>11 - Top of memory error</B>

 The top of DOS memory was at a lower address following the swap than it was
 before the swap. Do not execute programs like Quarterdeck's VIDRAM utility
 while a program is swapped out.

 The minor error code is the segment address at the top of memory.

 <B>12 - MCB chain corrupt</B>

 The swap function detected that the DOS memory control block chain was
 corrupted.

 The minor error code is the segment address of the corrupted MCB.

 <B>13 - Too many MCBs</B>

 The swap function can only save programs that own 128 or fewer DOS memory
 control blocks, which is more than sufficient in most cases.

 The minor error code is the number of MCBs.

 <B>14 - DOS memory function call error</B>

 DOS returned an error on a memory-related function call. Please contact
 technical support with full details of the situation causing the error.

 The minor code is the associated DOS error code.

 <B>15 - Unable to allocate same segment</B>

 In order to restore the program image correctly, the swap function must be
 able to allocate the same memory blocks that the program originally owned.
 This message indicates that DOS returned a block at a different address than
 the swap function expected. The program cannot be correctly restored.

 The minor error code is the segment address returned by DOS.

 <B>16 - Unable to find COMSPEC in environment</B>

 The swap function needs to locate the command interpreter (usually
 COMMAND.COM) in order to execute the child process. This error indicates
 that the COMSPEC environment variable that specifies the location of the
 command interpreter could not be found. Make sure you have a valid COMSPEC
 setting in the environment.

 <B>254 - Swap internal error</B>

 Please contact technical support with full details of the situation causing
 this error.

 <B>255 - Swap internal error</B>

 Please contact technical support with full details of the situation causing
 this error.
