 <B>1128: &lt;file(module)&gt; : unrecognized .OBJ record type nnh</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Blinker encountered an object record type which is not currently supported.
 It is possible that the module in question is corrupted.

 If recreating or reinstalling the module does not solve the problem then
 please contact Blinker technical support with your serial number and a
 description of the problem.

 Also, Blinker may have encountered a new type of object record, such as one
 created by a new compiler version not supported by the version of Blinker
 being used. If not using the latest version of Blinker, please enquire about
 upgrading.
