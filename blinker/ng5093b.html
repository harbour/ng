 <B>1199: internal error - DOS function call error</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Error messages 1189-1199 should not occur during normal operation.

 One of the most common causes within this group of errors is a memory
 conflict. Run the BLINKMEM utility, which is included with Blinker, to check
 for such conflicts.

 Another common cause of these errors is a corrupted object file or library.
 Re-run the link with the keyword VERBOSE added: the last module or library
 listed (or, in some cases, the module or library after the last one listed,
 in the sequence of the link script) will most likely be the offending file.
 Rebuild or reinstall the file.

 If none of these procedures resolve the error, please contact Blinker
 technical support with your serial number and exact details of the
 circumstances causing the error.
