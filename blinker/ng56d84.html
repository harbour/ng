 <B>1305: maximum selector limit exceeded</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the maximum number of selectors for a program
 (approximately 8000) has been exceeded. This will typically be caused by an
 application program allocating a large number of small segments.

 The solution is to modify the program to allocate larger segments and manage
 them by subdividing them inside the program, in the same ways as the C
 standard library malloc and free functions.
