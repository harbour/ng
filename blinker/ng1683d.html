 <B>FILE                          Specify object file(s)</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify object file(s)</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>FILE [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt; [, [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt; ...]</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>FILE Myapp1, D:\APPS\OBJ\Myapp2</B></U>

 The FILE command is used to specify to the linker the names of one or more
 .OBJ files to be included in the output file at that point. The default file
 extension of .OBJ need not be specified. The first file specified will
 generally be the program's main module.

 Several filenames may be specified within a single FILE command, separated
 by commas. Blinker will interpret a carriage return / linefeed combination
 as the end of a FILE command, therefore the FILE command must be restated at
 the beginning of each line.

 All files listed in FILE commands are included in the linked program,
 whether they are required or not. To include only the files needed by the
 specific program, a library (.LIB) file should be created using a librarian
 such as Microsoft LIB.EXE. This library can then be linked into the program
 using the LIBRARY command, and only the required .OBJ files from the .LIB
 file will be linked to the program.

 Blinker looks for each file first in the current directory and then in each
 directory path specified in the OBJ environment variable in the order they
 appear. Alternatively, a full drive and directory path may be specified with
 any or each of the file names.

 The FILE command can be used on a library file to force all the modules
 within the library to be included in the .EXE. In this case the .LIB
 extension and full path will probably need to be specified, e.g. FILE
 path\CLD.LIB.
