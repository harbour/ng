 <B>3.2. Add on / 3rd party libraries</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Please note that many add on libraries written in C or Assembler will
 require updates to allow them to be used in protected mode and dual mode
 programs.

 When a library is overlaid in a Dual mode program, a special link script or
 a root portion of the library may be required, in the same way as with a
 normal overlaid program. Please ensure that you are using the correct link
 script or library file.

 The file 3RDPARTY.DOC on the distribution disk contains the latest
 information we have available. The information was supplied by the vendors
 concerned, so is provided on an as is basis and Blink, Inc makes no
 guarantee that the information is correct.

 Note: All the overlay manager commands and functions are still applicable to
 a Dual mode program when it is running in real mode, so be sure to set up an
 overlay cache, enable OVERLAY PAGEFRAME if possible and set a sufficient
 overlay area size etc.
