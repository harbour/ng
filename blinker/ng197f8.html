 <B>NOEXTDICTIONARY               Disable processing of extended library dictionaries</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Disable processing of extended library dictionaries</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>NOEXTDICTIONARY</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 This command specifies that Blinker should ignore the extended dictionary
 which is appended to library files by some librarian utility programs. The
 extended dictionary is a cross reference of the library contents, and is
 used by Blinker to speed up the processing of libraries.

 If use of the extended dictionary is disabled using this command, Blinker
 will process the library slightly slower. Some librarians have been known to
 create invalid extended dictionaries, which can lead to erratic results at
 link time - this command will ensure that such libraries will be processed
 correctly.

 This command applies globally to all libraries processed during the link.
