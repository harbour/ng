 <B>STUB                          Add DOS stub to beginning of program file</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Add a DOS stub to the beginning of the program file</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>STUB ['filename' | NONE]</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>STUB 'MYSTUB.EXE'</B></U>

 The stub added to the program will be called whenever the program is run
 under DOS. Normally it will display a warning message and terminate
 execution of the program.

 A small stub program to do just this is automatically added to each Windows
 .EXE created by Blinker when no STUB command has been specified.

 The PATH environment variable will be searched if the specified file is not
 in the current directory.

 The keyword NONE causes the .EXE to be created without a stub program, thus
 making a slightly smaller executable. However, if the .EXE is run from the
 DOS prompt the system will most likely lock up, so this is not advised.
