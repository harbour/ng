 <B>1309: no more memory available</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the temporary swap file created by the virtual
 memory system has filled the disk on which it was created, or that the
 virtual memory sytem limit of 64 MB has been reached.

 Check that the program is not looping allocating memory, and if not then
 make more space available on the temporary drive or change the drive to
 which the virtual memory swaps.
