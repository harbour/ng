 <B>The Extender API</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 <B>Naming conventions</B>

 All the extender API functions are prefixed with the letters `Dos' to
 indicate that they are part of the DOS extender API and are covered in more
 detail in the alphabetical function reference in Chapter 10. All these
 functions are intended to be called from languages which can use the Pascal
 calling conventions, precluding certain high level languages such as
 CA-Clipper.

 Blinker also provides a generic get status function BLIMGRSTS() which can be
 used in all languages to obtain certain status information about the
 currently executing program. By its very nature this information will have
 been fixed at program start up, so no equivalent function to set these
 values is available, although they can all be controlled from the BLINKER
 environment variable.

 Since BLIMGRSTS() can be called from any language, it uses the normal
 calling conventions for the language being used, and takes an integer
 parameter indicating the type of status information required. #defines or
 their equivalents are included in the header files BLX286.* for each of the
 major compilers and languages.

 In the subsequent discussions and examples, the following terms are used:

 <U>Descriptor <B>A structure containing the size, base and attributes of a</B></U>
            <B>protected mode segment.</B>

 <U>Paragraph  <B>The segment portion of a real mode address , e.g. the paragraph</B></U>
            <B>of the colour adapter is B800h.</B>

 <U>Segment    <B>The actual code or data unit as allocated and stored in memory.</B></U>

 <U>Selector   <B>The value used to identify a segment when running in protected</B></U>
            <B>mode, i.e. that is passed to and from the protected mode memory</B>
            <B>allocation functions.</B>

 <B>Calling conventions</B>

 All the API functions use the Pascal calling convention, except where
 otherwise noted. This means that the function arguments are pushed onto the
 stack from left to right, and the code calling the function is NOT
 responsible for removing them from the stack.

 Far calls must be used with all the API functions, and all pointers must
 also be of type far.

 All the API functions return an unsigned integer (short) in AX to indicate
 the success or failure of the function. A zero value indicates success and
 any other value is an error code. All other registers are preserved. If the
 function is required to return any other value or result, it will take as a
 parameter one or more pointers to variables in which to store the results.

 <B>Header files</B>

 Header files defining prototypes for the API functions and their parameters
 are provided for interfacing to C/C++, Pascal and Modula. These files can be
 found in the appropriate language subdirectory and are named BLX286.*.

 The header files also contain definitions of any data structures required by
 the API, along with a number of macros to simplify their use.
