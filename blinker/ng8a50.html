 <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE IPX        Specify number of IPX ecbs and send buffers</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify number of IPX ecbs and send buffers</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE IPX &lt;ecb count&gt;[,&lt;send buffer</B></U>
            <B>count&gt;]</B>

 <U>Default  : <B>64,32</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Specify 48 ecbs and 16 send packet buffers</B></U>
            <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE IPX 48,16</B>

 The Blinker Dos extender provides transparent Novell IPX and SPX support
 (Novell network communications), which requires low memory buffers to be
 allocated by the extender for both send and receive events.

 This command specifies the number of IPX ECBs and send buffers that the DOS
 extended executable will be able to use.

 Two types of buffers are required by the IPX/SPX module. The first type are
 the ECBs (event control blocks) one of which is needed for each pending send
 or receive event. The second type of buffers are the send packet buffers
 which hold data which has been submitted to IPX/SPX, but has yet to be sent
 (pending send events). In the case of ECBs, the number required is the total
 number of pending events that have been submitted to IPX, but have not yet
 completed at any given time. The number of send buffers required is the
 total number of simultaneous active send events.

 Each ECB buffer specified requires approximately 42 bytes of conventional
 memory, and each send buffer specified requires approximately 550 bytes. The
 total size of both types of buffers may not exceed 64K when added together.

 Unless your program posts a large number of IPX listens, or sends a large
 number of packets simultaneously, the default values should be sufficient.

 No memory is allocated by the extender until the first IPX call is made.
