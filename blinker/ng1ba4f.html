 <B>SECTION INTO                  Specify files to be placed in external overlay</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify files to be placed in an external overlay</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>SECTION INTO &lt;ovlname&gt; [FILE [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt;</B></U>
            <B>[, [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt;...] ]</B>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>FILE MAIN</B></U>
            <B>BEGINAREA</B>
            <B>SECTION INTO OVL1</B>
            <B>FILE ABC, DEF, GHI # Placed in OVL1</B>
            <B>SECTION INTO OVL2</B>
            <B>FILE JKL, MNO, PQR # Placed in OVL2</B>
            <B>ENDAREA</B>

 The SECTION INTO command is used to specify the name of an external overlay
 file for the overlays. The file may have any extension except .EXE, and if
 no extension is specified then .OVL is assumed. The first SECTION INTO
 command must precede the first overlaid FILE command, otherwise an internal
 overlay within the OUTPUT file will be created and all SECTION INTO commands
 will be ignored. Note that this command does NOT cause overlays to be
 created, it merely causes overlays (if any) to be stored external to the EXE
 file (in OVL files). The BEGINAREA and ENDAREA commands are used to create
 overlays.

 Once an overlay file has been specified using the SECTION INTO command, all
 overlaid code will be placed in the same file until a SECTION INTO command
 with a different file name is found. At this time a new overlay file will be
 created. Output may be spread between the overlay files by the use of
 multiple SECTION INTO commands.

 Once an internal overlay has been created, all SECTION INTOs will be ignored
 and all overlaid procedures will be stored internally. Once an external
 overlay has been created it is not possible to create an internal overlay.
 Blinker has a limit of 15 external overlays in this version.

 At program runtime, one file handle is allocated to each overlay file, so it
 may be necessary to increase the number of file handles available to the
 program.
