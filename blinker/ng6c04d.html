 <B>SEGMENTS                      Set attributes for specific segments</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Set attributes for specific segments</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>SEGMENTS [']segname['] [CLASS 'classname']</B></U>
            <B>[attribute [attribute ...]]</B>

 <U>Example  : <B>SEGMENTS</B></U>
            <B>seg1 CLASS 'mycode' EXECUTEONLY</B>
            <B>seg2 CLASS 'mydata'</B>

 The SEGMENTS command sets attributes for one or more segments on a segment
 by segment basis, overriding the defaults set by the CODE and DATA commands.
 The sequence of specified segments establishes their order in the output
 file. The segment class defaults to 'CODE' if CLASS 'classname' is not
 specified.

 The following attributes may be specified , with the defaults shown first
 for each set of options :

 discard [NONDISCARDABLE | DISCARDABLE]

    This is used only for CODE and SEGMENTS commands. It determines whether a
    code segment can be discarded from memory to fill a different memory
    request.

 execute [EXECUTEREAD | EXECUTEONLY]

    This is used only for CODE and SEGMENTS commands. It determines whether a
    code segment can be read as well as executed. The EXECUTEREAD option is
    necessary for a program to run under a debugger which processes CodeView
    information.

 instance [MULTIPLE | SINGLE | NONE]

    This is used for the DATA command only. It affects the sharing attributes
    of DGROUP, the default data segment. This option interacts with the
    shared attribute.

    MULTIPLE, the default for programs, specifies that DGROUP is copied for
    each instance of the program.

    SINGLE, which is the default for DLLs, specifies that one DGROUP is
    shared by all instances of the DLL or program.

    NONE tells the loader not to allocate DGROUP. This is used when a DLL has
    no data and uses the program's DGROUP.

    This option interacts with the shared attribute for data segments.

 load [LOADONCALL | PRELOAD]

    This is used for CODE, DATA and SEGMENTS commands. It determines when a
    segment is loaded. LOADONCALL specifies that the segment should not be
    loaded until accessed, and only if not already loaded. PRELOAD specifies
    that the segment should be loaded when the program starts.

 moveable [FIXED | MOVEABLE]

    This is used for CODE, DATA and SEGMENTS commands. It determines whether
    a segment of a Windows program can be moved in memory. This command can
    also be used to force segments of a DOS extended program to be loaded in
    conventional memory.

 read [READWRITE | READONLY]

    This is used for DATA and SEGMENTS commands only. It determines access
    rights to a data segment.

 shared [NONSHARED | SHARED]

    This is used for real-mode Windows sessions only. It determines whether
    all instances of the program can share EXECUTEREAD and READWRITE
    segments.

    NONSHARED, which is the default for programs, specifies that the segment
    must be loaded seperately for each process. An alternative keyword is
    IMPURE.

    SHARED, which is the default for DLLs, specifies that only one copy of
    the segment should be loaded and shared among all processes that access
    the program or DLL. This setting saves memory and can be used for code
    that is not self-modifying. An alternative keyword is PURE. This option
    interacts with the instance attribute for data segments.
