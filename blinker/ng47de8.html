 <B>1123: &lt;file(module)&gt; : compiled with 5.x not Summer '87</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that Blinker has determined that the specified module
 was compiled with CA-Clipper 5.x, but that the first FILE in the application
 was compiled with CA-Clipper Summer '87. All CA-Clipper compiled modules in
 a single application must be compiled with the same version of CA-Clipper.

 Ensure you are linking the correct versions of the CA-Clipper libraries and
 any third party libraries for the version of CA-Clipper that you are using,
 and also make sure all CA-Clipper-compiled .OBJ files were compiled with the
 same version of CA-Clipper.
