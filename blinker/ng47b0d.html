 <B>1122: &lt;file(module)&gt; : compiled with Summer '87 not 5.x</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that Blinker has determined that the specified module
 was compiled with CA-Clipper Summer '87, but that the first FILE in the
 application was compiled with CA-Clipper 5.x. All CA-Clipper compiled
 modules in a single application must be compiled with the same version of
 CA-Clipper.

 Ensure you are linking the correct versions of the CA libraries and any
 third party libraries for the version of CA-Clipper that you are using, and
 also make sure all CA-Clipper compiled .OBJ files were compiled with the
 same version of CA-Clipper.
