 <B>NAME                          Create application program and name it</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Create an application program and name it</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>NAME [appname] [apptype] [NEWFILES]</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>NAME myapp</B></U>

 This statement identifies the executable file as a program as opposed to a
 DLL. If it is used then the LIBRARY command cannot also be used. If neither
 are specified then NAME is the default.

 appname is the application name as it is known by the operating system, and
 cannot exceed 255 characters. If not specified, it defaults to the base name
 of the executable file.

 apptype is one of three optional keywords:

    WINDOWAPI. This is the default and creates a Windows-based program. The
    program uses the API provided by Windows and must be executed within
    Windows.

    WINDOWCOMPAT. This option creates a character-mode program to run in a
    text window within a Windows session.

    NOTWINDOWCOMPAT. This creates a character-mode program which must run
    full screen and cannot run in a text window within a Windows session.

 The NEWFILES keyword notifies the loader that the program may be using an
 installable file system. The synonym LONGNAMES is supported for
 compatibility.
