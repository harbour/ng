 <B>MODULE                        Specify placement of individual library modules </B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify placement of individual library modules</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>MODULE &lt;module&gt; [,&lt;module&gt; ...]</B></U>
            <B>[FROM &lt;libname&gt;]</B>

 <U>Example  : <B># Move the module COLOR to the current location</B></U>
            <B>MODULE COLOR</B>

 The MODULE command allows individual modules to be forced into the root or
 the overlay area regardless of whether the originating libraries or object
 modules are specified within an overlay area or not.

 The module name refers to an object module that exists within a library
 which has been specified elsewhere in the link script with a LIB or SEARCH
 command. Blinker's VERBOSE command output lists all modules that are
 processed at link time.

 The position of the module command within the link script determines the
 placement of the named module within the executable - if the MODULE command
 is in the root the named modules will be forced into the root; if it is in
 the overlay area, the named modules will be overlaid. Multiple modules can
 be specified on the same command line separated by ','.

 The library and module names should be specified without path names; if
 included, they will be ignored. The VERBOSE command can be used to determine
 the correct module name to use, since it displays each module name as it is
 processed from the library or object module. This is the same name as used
 by the Microsoft librarian (LIB.EXE).

 MODULE commands are case insensitive, (upper or lower case will be treated
 the same) unless the MIXCASE command has been specified in the script file
 before the MODULE command.

 The MODULE command has a second mode of operation, whereby a source library
 is specified using the FROM &lt;libname&gt; option. This allows modules from
 specific libraries to be used in preference to others, and at the same time
 performs the normal MODULE function of changing the placement of routines in
 the root or overlay area. This is useful to resolve a conflict between two
 libraries which contain modules with the same name.

 It is advisable to use the FROM option only when necessary, since it
 modifies the normal linking sequence.

    <B>MODULE DBEDIT, MEMOEDIT FROM EXTEND</B>

 This command forces the modules DBEDIT and MEMOEDIT from EXTEND to be used
 in preference to modules of the same name which may have been found
 previously in other libraries or files, AND moves those modules to the
 current location in the script file.

    <B>MODULE MEMOEDIT FROM NUL</B>

 This command forces the module MEMOEDIT not to be linked at all, since
 Blinker will be looking for a library called NUL, which cannot exist. If,
 however, something in MEMOEDIT is explicitly referenced by another module,
 this will cause an unresolved external. To override this, use the DEFINE
 command rather than the MODULE command, and DEFINE the public symbols within
 the module which are unresolved.
