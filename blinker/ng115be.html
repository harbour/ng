 <B>BLINKER OVERLAY THRESHOLD     Set size of smallest overlaid segments</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Set size of the smallest overlaid segments</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER OVERLAY THRESHOLD &lt;nuLimit&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>32 bytes</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Only overlay segments larger than 64 bytes</B></U>
            <B>BLINKER OVERLAY THRESHOLD 64</B>

 This command sets the threshold size below which code specified to be
 overlaid will be moved back to the root section of the program. Very small
 routines (less than 32 bytes) take up more root space when they are
 overlaid, due to overlay manager table entries, than they would if they were
 simply left in the root.

 Additionally, very small overlaid routines execute disproportionately
 slower, since the time overhead in loading / calling them may be large in
 comparison with the actual execution time of the routine. If it is the case
 that very small routines are very frequently called, the developer may wish
 to specify a threshold large enough to cause them to be moved back to the
 root, improving the performance of the program.

 <B>CA-Clipper 5.x note</B>

 This command has no effect on CA-Clipper 5.x code overlaid through the
 paging system, but could be used, for example, for C functions within a
 CA-Clipper program.
