 <B>1307: unable to load segment</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the DOS extender loader was unable to load a
 segment when a segment not present exception occurred. This is similar to
 being unable to load an overlay, and typically indicates that the .EXE file
 has become corrupt or has been overwritten. Please attempt to reinstall or
 recreate the .EXE file which gave the error.
