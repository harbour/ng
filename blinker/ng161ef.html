 <B>EXTRAMEM                      Limit amount of memory allocated to program</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Limit the amount of memory allocated to the program</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>EXTRAMEM nuSize</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>1 MB - (physical image size)</B></U>

 The EXTRAMEM command is used to limit the amount of extra memory DOS will
 allocate to a program. The parameter is the size, as a decimal number of
 paragraphs beyond the image size, of the largest memory block into which DOS
 will load the program. This is equivalent to the /CPARM option of MSLink.

 This command is used, amongst other things, to reduce the size of the near
 heap in Medium and Large model programs.

 There are three figures associated with the memory requirements of a DOS
 executable file:

    a) The physical image size of the root portion of the executable.
    b) The additional amount of memory required for uninitialised data.
    c) Additional memory requested by the program. This value is normally set
       to 1MB, causing DOS to allocate the largest available contiguous memory
       block to the program at load time.

 The figure represented by (a+b) is known as the load size, and is the amount
 of memory that DOS requires to load the program into memory.

 The EXTRAMEM command specifies a number of paragraphs to be allocated to the
 program in ADDITION to the physical image size, and must be at least as
 large as (b). If the number of paragraphs specified is LESS than (b),
 Blinker will automatically increase the EXTRAMEM figure to the minimum
 value.
