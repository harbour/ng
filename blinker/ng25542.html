 <B>BLIOVLOPS()                   Get size of overlay pool memory.</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Function : <B>Get size of overlay pool memory.</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>nlValue = BLIOVLOPS()</B></U>

 <U>Return   : <B>Overlay Pool Operating Size in bytes</B></U>

 This function returns the operating size of the overlay pool in bytes.

 This is set at link time using the BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE &lt;size&gt; command, or
 at run time using the /OOnn setting in the BLINKER environment variable.
 (see Chapter 9, BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE).

 The figure returned by this function represents the requested size of the
 overlay area at the time the program started running. This value will be the
 most recent of the value set at link time with the BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE
 nnn command and the /OOnnn setting of the BLINKER environment variable at
 runtime. The actual size of the area allocated may vary depending on the
 availability of EMS and UMBs and the settings of the appropriate BLINKER
 options. See the function BLIOVLSIZ() for details of the actual size
 allocated.

 CA-Clipper Summer '87 DYNAMIC method note:

 When using the BLINKER OVERLAY DYNAMIC (the default) method of overlay
 allocation, this size is the maximum amount of memory which Blinker will
 allocate from CA-Clipper for overlays. Once Blinker has used this much
 memory for overlays, it will discard unused overlays to free up space for
 the next overlay, rather than allocating more dynamic memory from CA-Clipper
 to store the overlay.

 During execution the overlay manager may be forced to increase this value if
 overlays become heavily nested, since all active overlays must remain in
 memory with the DYNAMIC method. The new value will remain current until the
 program is ended unless a BLIOVLCLR() is executed. In this case the OPSIZE,
 and therefore the value returned by the BLIOVLOPS() function, will be reset
 to the value defined at start-up.

 Example:

    <B>* Get the overlay pool operating size.</B>
    <B>*</B>
    <B>? "The overlay pool operating size is "</B>
    <B>?? BLIOVLOPS(), "bytes"</B>
