 <B>1106: not enough real memory to link</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that Blinker could not allocate enough real (DOS)
 memory to continue the link.

 Blinker has a link time virtual memory system that can use EMS (3.2 and
 higher), XMS (2.0 and higher) memory (or disk space) when conventional DOS
 memory is fully allocated. However, Blinker still requires a certain amount
 of conventional DOS memory to complete the link cycle.

 To make more memory available, either remove one or more TSRs currently
 resident, run Blinker from outside a make utility or reduce the number of
 buffers specified in the CONFIG.SYS. Reducing the number of SECTION INTO and
 SEARCH commands will also reduce the memory needed at link time.
