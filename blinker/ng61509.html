 <B>Overview</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 <B>Protected mode</B>

 Protected mode refers to the enhanced mode of the 80286 and above. These
 processors were designed with backwards compatibility as being of primary
 importance, but with the need to extend the address space beyond 1 Mb.

 When these processors are powered up they start running in 8086 mode, known
 as real mode, and in the absence of any special software will continue to
 run as an 8086, only with better performance due to their increased clock
 speeds and reduced instruction execution times.

 Specific software instructions may be used to switch the processor into one
 of its enhanced modes at any time, at which point the processor starts to
 function as a more advanced processor with a number of extra capabilities,
 including the ability to access more than 1 Mb of memory. The processor may
 be switched in and out of protected mode at any time if required, although
 the 80286 requires a significant amount of time (milliseconds) each time a
 switch to protected mode is requested.

 When running in 80286 protected mode, rather than interpreting the segment
 as an absolute memory address the processor interprets it as an index into a
 look up table which contains 24-bit physical base addresses for all the
 memory segments in the system. Using this 24 bit base address and a 16 bit
 offset allows the processor to address 16 Mb of physical memory. The memory
 is still segmented, however, with the largest segment still being 64 Kb.

 <B>DOS Extenders</B>

 The 80286 processor and above will run in real mode until otherwise
 instructed, and DOS itself is written in such a way that it can only run in
 real mode. The idea behind a DOS extender is to run the actual program in
 protected mode, giving it access to all the extra memory and features
 available, and then temporarily switch back to real mode whenever a DOS or
 BIOS service is required which cannot be fielded in protected mode.

 A DOS extender will typically have a real mode code portion loaded in DOS
 conventional memory and a protected mode code portion loaded in extended
 memory. The real mode portion will load and execute the user program, and
 will receive control any time a request for, or access to, a system resource
 is made by the program. The protected mode portion will usually contain
 replacement code for some of the services offered by DOS or the BIOS, so in
 many cases it will perform the function and then return to the user program
 without having to leave protected mode.

 If the request will require DOS or the BIOS to be activated, however, the
 DOS extender will save the current protected mode status of the processor,
 switch back to real mode and then invoke its real mode portion. This portion
 may then field the request itself or pass it on to DOS or BIOS in the normal
 way. Once the request has been processed, control returns to the real mode
 portion which will return to protected mode and the protected mode portion.
 This can now restore the protected mode status and continue execution of the
 user program.

 DOS extenders are able to use the specific features of the 80286 or the
 80386, and obviously require a minimum of the processor for which they have
 been written. In all cases, because the 80x86 processors are backwards
 compatible, the DOS extender will also run on any processor more advanced
 than the one for which it is written.

 80286 DOS extenders run in 16 bit protected mode, which provides access to
 up to 16 Mb of memory in 64 Kb segments. Because it is still managed in 64
 Kb segments, most high level language code will run in 16 bit protected mode
 with only minor modifications and incompatibilities. Typically a recompile
 and relink with some replacement .OBJ and .LIB files provided as part of the
 DOS extender will allow a program to be up and running in 16 bit protected
 mode, at which point the programmer can start to iron out the
 incompatibilities.

 80386 DOS extenders run in 32 bit protected mode, which provides up to 4 Gb
 of memory in one or more segments, so most programs will treat the memory as
 a linear address space contained in one segment. Because the address space
 is linear and segments are not limited in size to 64 Kb, more major
 incompatibilities in existing programs will arise. In the case of high level
 languages, 32 bit versions of the compiler are usually necessary in order to
 make use of 32 bit protected mode, and these compilers will automatically
 prohibit most of the constructs which are not allowed when executing in
 protected mode.

 Windows 3.x enhanced mode is actually this 32 bit protected mode. We will
 make no further mention of 32 bit protected mode as the DOS extender
 provided with Blinker is a 286 DOS extender which will run on any processor
 from an 80286 processor with 2MB of memory up to the largest Pentium.

 Because of the potential problems in a DOS environment of multiple programs
 wishing to switch back and forth into protected mode, particularly between
 EMS emulators and DOS extenders, two major programming interfaces were
 proposed to manage protected mode switching. The first of these was the
 Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) which is specific to 80386 and
 80486 processors, and the second and more general is DOS Protected Mode
 Interface (DPMI), which applies to the 80286 and above. Please refer to
 Appendix C - Further reading - for more details on these specifications and
 how to program to them.

 <B>Performance implications</B>

 Programs running under a 286 DOS extender have transparent access to up to
 16MB of directly addressable memory. Memory intensive programs, particularly
 those using large numbers of data structures e.g. arrays, will therefore run
 significantly faster in protected mode. Also, since there is usually no need
 for overlaying of code, execution of the code itself is faster because
 pauses to load code from disk are rare.

 On the other hand, programs running under a DOS extender which heavily
 access DOS, the BIOS or other external resources will often be continually
 switching between real and protected mode, so may run slower than in real
 mode. This is extremely program dependent. The overhead of switching between
 real and protected mode varies significantly between different machines, and
 reduces drastically when moving from a 286 to a 386 and 486 processor.

 Language compiler memory managers sometimes perform inefficiently when given
 megabytes of data, since they were only designed to manage a few hundred Kb
 of data. This is another area where performance may be adversely affected.
 For this reason Blinker provides replacement memory management functions for
 some of the more popular compilers.
