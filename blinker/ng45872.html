 <B>1113: segment &lt;name&gt; or its group exceeds 64kb</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates one of a number of situations :

 Two related libraries may have been separated by other libraries in the link
 script file, so that the code in one library cannot reach the code in the
 other library. This may also occur when related .OBJ files, possibly
 extracted from the same library, have been separated by too many other .OBJ
 files in the script file.

 Non-overlayable code may have been overlaid. When third party products are
 linked into the program, please refer to the file 3RDPARTY.DOC supplied on
 the distribution diskette and to the products' documentation for their
 suggested method for dynamic overlaying.

 Two libraries may have declared the same segment names in different classes,
 which should not occur in most programs.

 Two or more libraries may have been specified in an incorrect order within
 the link script. See the section, "Ordering the Libraries" in chapter 4 of
 this manual.

 The program's default data segment (usually named DGROUP in the program's
 MAP file) may have exceeded 64K in size. Try changing near data to far data,
 by declaring large data items as far, or instruct the compiler to do this
 automatically, e.g. using the Microsoft C/C++ -Gt compile switch.If using
 Borland C/C++, try changing the large memory model compile option to huge.
 If using CA-Clipper, determine which 3rd-party product is using the most of
 DGROUP by systematically removing each library and running the program with
 the //INFO parameter of the CLIPPER environment variable enabled. When the
 offending library is found, please contact that product's technical support.

 If these approaches do not work, and recreating or reinstalling the
 specified file does not help, then please contact Blinker technical support
 with exact details of the problem.

 <B>CA-Clipper note:</B>

 For CA-Clipper applications, the usual cause of this problem is that the
 first .OBJ file specified on the command line or in the script file is not a
 CA-Clipper .OBJ file. When linking a CA-Clipper application the first .OBJ
 file specified must be the CA-Clipper starting program.

 If the first .OBJ file is definitely a CA-Clipper .OBJ then please review
 Chapter 4 which discusses the order of third party libraries in the script
 file.
