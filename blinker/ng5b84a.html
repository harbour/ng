 <B>Microsoft CodeView</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Overview</B>

 Note: The Microsoft CodeView debugger CANNOT be used to debug DOS Extended
 programs - instead use a debugger such as Soft-Ice/W or Periscope/32 for
 Windows.

 Blinker supports CodeView debugging of REAL mode programs with compilers
 that produce CodeView information levels 0, 1, 2 and 5. This encompasses all
 MS compilers through C/C++ version 7.x and Visual C++ (C8), Visual BASIC for
 DOS 1.0, BASIC PDS 7.1, Pascal 4.0, Fortran 5.0 and MASM 6.x. At the time of
 writing, other manufacturer's compilers that produce CodeView information
 comply with this requirement. To enable Blinker's processing of CodeView
 information, add the following command to your link script:

    <B>CODEVIEW</B>

 <B>CodeView Versions</B>

 CodeView version numbers in this discussion relate to the version number of
 the information, not to any particular revision of the CodeView debugger
 software.

 The CodeView information that Blinker produces by default conforms to the
 lowest level of support, that is CodeView version 0. This level of
 information is supported by all versions of CodeView and any utility that
 makes use of CodeView information. However, later versions of the CodeView
 debugger may support additional features that are not suppported by
 information level 0. In this case you will need to instruct Blinker to
 produce information to a higher level than the default. The CVVERSION
 command is used for this purpose:

    <B>CVVERSION 5    # Provide level 5 Codeview support as</B>
    <B>               # required by Microsoft Visual C++</B>

 Valid CodeView versions are 0, 1, 2 and 5. Do not use a CodeView version
 number higher than that which your debugger supports.

 <B>CodeView and Overlays</B>

 Note: you must always use external overlay(s) when debugging overlaid
 programs under CodeView.

 The CodeView information standard prior to version 5 makes no provision for
 the concept of a dynamic overlay linker like Blinker, the reason being that
 Microsoft overlay linkers could create only statically overlaid programs.
 Version 5 is supported by the CodeView that comes with Microsoft Visual C++,
 and by most compatible compilers, so users of those compilers need read no
 further.

 For older versions of CodeView the primary difference is that with a
 statically overlaid program, the address at which an overlay will execute
 can be determined at program link time, as it is within the executable
 image, whereas a dynamically linked program executes overlays at an address
 the can only be determined at program run time.

 In order for Blinker to provide compatibility with the CodeView standard,
 and still retain the advantages of dynamic overlaying, Blinker creates a
 static overlay area, the size of which is determined by the largest overlaid
 object module, within the executable image. At program execution time, the
 overlay manager will identify those modules that are within a 'CodeView
 area' and copy them into the static area for execution. The creation of the
 static overlay area within the program image will increase the loadsize of
 the program by the size of the largest overlaid module for which codeview
 information is active.

 In order to allow you to single step and trace into overlaid modules,
 Blinker will create a source file with the same name as the executable, but
 with the extension .VEC. This file should be made available to CodeView at
 program execution time, as if it were one of your own source files. When
 tracing your program, follow the directions given in this source file as to
 when to step over and when to step into the overlay vectors and overlay
 manager.

 There is a penalty in execution speed while debugging overlaid code under
 the older versions of CodeView, which is primarily caused by the overlay
 manager having to copy modules into the static overlay area. In effect this
 causes a worst case overlay situation whereby modules are being constantly
 swapped in and out of a single memory area, the impact of which will vary
 depending on the program (and modules) being debugged. There are two things
 that can be done to help alleviate this problem:

    .  Limit the amount of code that is to be debugged by using CodeView
       areas
    .  Increase the size of the overlay cache to speed up overlay operations
