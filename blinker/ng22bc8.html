 <B>BLIMEMBLK()                   Get CA-Clipper Summer '87 free memory down to blocksize</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Function : <B>Get CA-Clipper Summer '87 free memory down to blocksize</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>nuValue = BLIMEMBLK([nuBlocksize])</B></U>

 <U>Return   : <B>Free memory in kb of blocks that are &gt;= [nuBlocksize]</B></U>

 This function returns the total dynamic memory available in kilobytes of
 blocks at least as large as the block specified in kb as a parameter.
 Dynamic memory is the memory used by CA-Clipper to store all temporary
 values of variables and buffers while an application is running.

 If no parameter is specified a default block size of 4kb is used, which
 simulates the value returned by a call to CA-Clipper's MEMORY(0). In all
 cases the function will emulate MEMORY(0) and attempt to allocate blocks of
 size 63 Kb, then 48 Kb, then 32 Kb, then 16 Kb, then 8, 4, 2 and 1Kb until
 no block larger or equal to the parameter or default can be allocated. The
 value returned will be the total size of the blocks successfully allocated.

 BLIMEMBLK() executes many times faster than MEMORY(0), so may be used to
 monitor memory in places where MEMORY(0) is found to slow the application
 too much, for example during indexing or profiling.

 Example:

    <B>* Get the available memory in minimum of 8 Kb blocks</B>
    <B>*</B>
    <B>? "Memory available in at least 8Kb blocks is "</B>
    <B>?? BLIMEMBLK(8), "Kb"</B>
