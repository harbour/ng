 <B>1313: exception error nn : &lt;exception type&gt;, code = nnnnh</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that a protection exception of the specified type has
 occured during the execution of the program. This is an application program
 error not a DOS extender error, and indicates that the application program
 has attempted an unauthorised operation.

 The exception types and a brief description of their causes are listed
 below. The numeric code will often indicate the value causing the error, for
 example an invalid selector being loaded into a segment register or a
 pointer beyond the end of a segment.

 This error message will be followed by a dump of all the processor registers
 and various other information. Analysis of this information is covered in
 more detail in Chapter 5, DOS Extended / Dual Mode Programs.

 <B>Exception 00: divide by zero attempted</B>

 This exception is generated by an attempt to divide a value by zero, and is
 normally handled by the compiler run time library when a high level language
 is being used.

 <B>Exception 05: bounds check failed</B>

 This exception is generated by a BOUND instruction when the value to be
 tested is less than the indicated lower bound or greater than the indicated
 upper bound.

 <B>Exception 06: undefined opcode</B>

 This exception is generated by an attempt to execute an opcode which is not
 defined for the processor the program is being run on.

 <B>Exception 07: no maths coprocessor available</B>

 This exception is generated by an attempt to execute a floating point
 instruction when the processor has no maths coprocessor available.

 <B>Exception 08: double exception fault</B>

 This exception is generated when multiple exceptions occur on one
 instruction, or an exception occurs in an exception handler.

 <B>Exception 0a: invalid task switch state segment</B>

 This exception is generated by an attempt to task switch to a segment with
 an invalid task state segment.

 <B>Exception 0c: stack overflow / underflow</B>

 This exception is generated by a limit violation in any operation which
 refers to the stack segment. This includes stack-oriented instructions such
 as PUSH and POP as well as other memory references which implicitly use the
 stack such as MOV AX,[BP].

 <B>Exception 0d: general protection fault</B>

 All protection violations which do not cause another exception cause a
 general protection exception. These include exceeding segment limits,
 attempting to load invalid selectors into segment registers, attempting to
 execute data and attempting to write to code.

 <B>Exception 0e: page fault</B>

 This exception is generated by an attempt to load a segment to an invalid
 memory address.
