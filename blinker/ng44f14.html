 <B>1109: unable to open file &lt;filename&gt;</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that Blinker was unable to find the specified file in
 the current directory where it was expected to be, so the full directory
 path for the file should be specified. If no file extension is specified for
 script files, Blinker assumes an extension of .LNK.

 If the file has been specified in the link script with a FILE command, then
 check the OBJ environment variable. If it has been specified with a LIBRARY
 or SEARCH command, check the LIB environment variable.

 This error can also occur when Blinker is attempting to create a swap file
 and the TEMP environment variable points to an invalid directory. When
 running on a network, it is also possible that another user deleted the file
 or that you do not have network access rights to the file.
