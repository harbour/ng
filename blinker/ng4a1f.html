 <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION DATE    Specify expiration date for demonstration version</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify expiration date for demonstration version</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION DATE &lt;yyyy/mm/dd&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Set the program expiration date</B></U>
            <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION DATE 1992/12/31</B>

 This command is used to set the expiration date of a program, after which it
 will end with the "demonstration date limit exceeded" message. It may be set
 to any date in the format yyyy/mm/dd.

 This can be used to create a demonstration version of the program without
 having to modify the source code. When the overlay manager loads overlays
 after the expiration date (as determined by the DOS system date), the error
 handling procedure BLERRPRG is called with error number 1208, indicating
 that the demonstration date limit has been exceeded. The source for this
 error handler is provided should you want to modify the text of the
 termination message.

 Note: The demonstration restrictions are only checked when overlays are
 called, so to use them please ensure that at least one function or procedure
 which is called regularly is overlaid. To be sure thatoverlays exist, be
 aware that any overlaid segment that is smaller than the BLINKER OVERLAY
 THRESHOLD default of 32 bytes will automatically be removed from the overlay
 area.

 <B>CA-Clipper 5.x note:</B>

 To include Blinker's overlay manager in the application, some non-CA-Clipper
 code must be overlaid, for example EXTEND.LIB.
