------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Overview</B>

 Blinker 3.2 includes full support for the Soft-Ice/W debugger for real,
 protected, dual and Windows programs on a SINGLE MACHINE. Soft-Ice/W
 actually loads and runs Windows and sits at the lowest system level, so it
 can debug anything at the source level, including VxDs and DOS protected
 mode programs.

 To use Soft-Ice/W with DOS real mode or protected mode programs simply open
 a DOS box, link for CODEVIEW with CVV 5, run WLDR xxxx.SYM (A SYM file is
 not actually needed) to load the symbols, source files etc and then run the
 program xxxx.EXE directly or WLDR xxxx.EXE. Do not use WLDR xxxx with no
 extension as there seems to be a problem loading DOS extended programs at
 the same time as their symbols.

 To enable the interception of the INT 3 debugging interrupt by Soft-Ice/W
 use the command 'I3HERE ON' at the Soft-Ice/W command line (pop up
 Soft-Ice/W using Ctrl D), or by including it in the INIT line in the
 Soft-Ice/W initialisation file WINICE.DAT.

 Soft-Ice/W will then pop up when it encounters an INT 3 in the code, when a
 Control D is pressed, or it can be forced to pop up at the very start of the
 program by setting the value /DI3 in the BLINKER environment variable as
 described in the previous section. Soft-Ice/W will then pop up on a far JMP
 to the very first line of the actual program, which can be stepped into with
 F8. As noted above, for high level languages the command 'G MAIN' will take
 you to start of the main program.
