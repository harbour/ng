 <B>1215: error accessing XMS overlay cache</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that an error has occurred while the Blinker overlay
 manager is accessing XMS for the storage and / or retrieval of overlays in
 the overlay cache. If the problem persists then disable the BLINKER CACHE
 XMS command in the link script file.

 If this fixes the problem then it is possible that you have a TSR or device
 driver working in the background which is manipulating XMS directly in a
 non-standard manner. Try removing all TSRs and device drivers from the
 system except for the XMS driver, and test if the problem still occurs . If
 it does then please contact Blinker technical support with your Blinker
 serial number, your system configuration and a description of the problem.
