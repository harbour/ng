 <B>1317: extender heap full</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the Blinker DOS extender heap has been
 completely used up, and should not occur in normal operation.

 It usually indicates that a large number of small allocations of memory have
 been made directly via the extender API, which in turn is usually caused by
 repeated allocation of a temporary buffer without it being freed each time.

 Check the program for endless recursion or failure to free a temporary
 memory allocation in a function which is called repeatedly.
