 <B>BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES    Enable warnings for duplicate modules within libraries</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Enable warnings for duplicate modules within libraries</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 This command causes Blinker to generate the 1004 link time warning message
 for all duplicate symbols encountered at link time. This command can be a
 very useful debugging tool for identifying duplicate modules among the files
 and libraries used in linking a program. The first module listed in the
 Blinker message 1004 is the module which is actually linked. The second
 module in the 1004 message is the duplicate and is ignored unless overridden
 with the MODULE FROM command.

 The following modules (and included symbols) are processed at link time and
 listed in the first half of the VERBOSE output. Each of these symbols will
 be listed in the generated 1004 messages if another processed symbol has the
 same name.

    . All modules specified in a FILE command.
    . Those modules extracted from a library to resolve external references.
    . All modules within a SEARCHed library.

 Note that there may be numerous duplicated modules or symbols in the
 included libraries which are not reported when BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES is
 used, since one or both of the modules are not processed.

 For optimal use of this command, it will help to understand the section "The
 Linking Process" in Chapter 3, which is a discussion of the method by which
 Blinker processes the files and libraries included in a single link. This
 method determines which modules are processed, and hence which modules are
 identified as duplicates in the output generated by the BLINKER MESSAGE
 DUPLICATES command.

 To obtain a list of all duplicated modules relevant to your program by using
 this command in conjunction with the VERBOSE command:

 (1) List all possible duplicates:

 The first half of the VERBOSE output will identify all modules processed
 during linking. The duplicates among these modules will be reported by the
 BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES command. Since you can force all modules within a
 library to be processed by SEARCHing that library, SEARCHing all included
 libraries will cause all modules within the program to be processed, and
 hence cause all duplicates to be listed. Linking with all these SEARCHes is
 only intended to produce the desired duplicate messages, not a viable .EXE.

 (2) Identify only those modules used in the program:

 The second half of the VERBOSE output will identify only those modules
 actually included in the final executable file. The symbols highlighted as
 duplicates whose modules appear in the second half of the VERBOSE listing
 are the ones to examine. Generally all duplicates between third party
 libraries or files which are provided by the same vendor are intended and
 can be ignored; also those duplicates between a third party product and a
 compiler library can be assumed to be intended.
