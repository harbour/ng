 <B>1218: symbol &lt;symbolname&gt; was not linked to the program</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the specified symbol name was not linked to the
 main .EXE file but was referenced from a .DLL. This message will typically
 only occur with CA-Clipper programs.

 Ensure that one of the modules linked to the main .EXE file contains a
 reference to the specifed symbol name. The code which does so does not
 actually have to be executed, but it must be linked in order to ensure that
 the appropriate run time functions are included in the .EXE file.
