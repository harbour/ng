------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Blinker now fully supports the creation of 16 bit OS/2 .EXE and .DLL files.
 To create OS/2 .EXEs and .DLLs simply create a link file as documented in
 the manual and use the module definition file(s) from your current OS/2
 linker.

 Programs linked with the Blinker 4.x DOS extender require a minimum of
 HIMEM.SYS to be installed on the destination machine in order to run in
 protected mode. If there is no memory manager at all present then dual mode
 programs will revert to running in real mode and extended mode programs will
 terminate with the following message :

    This is a DOS extended program which requires a minimum of a 286
    processor and at least nnnn KB of available DPMI, VCPI or XMS memory to
    run. Please ensure that your system is configured with a memory manager
    which provides these resources.

 All other memory managers such as QEMM, 386MAX , NetRoom etc are fully
 supported and are used to their full potential.

 Blinker searches for FILEs in the OBJ path AND THEN the LIB path before
 failing with a file not found error.
