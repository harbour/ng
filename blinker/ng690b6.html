 Keywords are not case sensitive.

 A NAME or LIBRARY statement, if used, must be listed before all others.

 If a statement is repeated with a different specification further on in the
 module definition file, the later statement overrides the earlier one.

 Comments in a module definition file are denoted by a semicolon (;). The
 semicolon can appear anywhere on the line, and all information on the rest
 of that line is ignored.

 If a string argument matches a reserved word it must be enclosed in double
 quotes (").
