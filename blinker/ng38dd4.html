 The SWPKEYBRD function allows the parent program to stuff the keyboard with
 a series of keystrokes prior to executing the child program. Use of this
 function will allow you complete control over the execution of the child
 program.

 SWPKEYBRD() should work with most child programs that use the BIOS keyboard
 functions 0,1,10H and 11H to read keyboard input. Programs that access the
 keyboard hardware directly (such as MS Word) will not see stuffed
 keystrokes, and so cannot be controlled by this function.

 The maximum number of keystrokes that can be stuffed is 250.

 <B>SWPKEYBRD Parameters</B>

 SWPKEYBRD takes a single string parameter made up of the following
 components:

    .  Embedded sub-strings
    .  Embedded sub-strings within quotes
    .  Special key combinations and keys that cannot be specified in ascii
       form, such as {pgup} and (alt-f1}

 Embedded sub-strings will usually contain ASCII characters found on the
 keyboard, such as A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !@#$%&amp;*() and so on. These characters are
 translated by SWPKEYBRD() into the keycodes associated with the keys that
 bear the character legend on a US keyboard.

 It is possible for an embedded sub-string to contain characters that are not
 present on the US keyboard, such as international characters, box and line
 characters and so on. When SWPKEYBRD() encounters such a character, it
 generates a keystroke that is the equivalent &lt;alt-nnn&gt; keycode, where nnn is
 the ascii value of the character in question.

 <B>Quotes</B>

 Embedded substrings may start and end with either a single (') or a double
 (") quote, but they must match. This allows you to use either within the
 quoted text:

    <B>swpkeybrd("{enter}'he said "hello" twice'{enter}")</B>
    <B>swpkeybrd('{enter}"Please press 'X' now!"{enter}')</B>

 Note that most compilers will use the first and last quote within the string
 as delimiters. The string you pass to SWPKEYBRD() must be within another set
 of quotes.

 <B>Non-ASCII Key combinations</B>

 In addition to quoted text, SWPKEYBRD() can also pass other keystrokes that
 cannot be represented by ASCII characters. Many of these keystrokes may be
 used in conjunction with a shift state. The three available shift states
 are:

    <B>shift, ctrl, and alt</B>

 When a shift state key is specified, it should precede the actual key
 definition, and be separated from it by a '-' character. eg:

    <B>{shift-f7}{ctrl-a}{alt-esc}</B>

 You cannot use more than one shift state at a time - the BIOS does not
 support this. If the child program uses multiple shift states
 simultaneously, such as &lt;ctrl}+&lt;alt&gt;, &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;shift&gt;, you will not be able
 to control it using SWPKEYBRD(), as it either directly accesses the keyboard
 hardware, or it uses shift state information in the BIOS data area, which
 SWPKEYBRD() does not attempt to emulate.

 The following keys are available:

    {f1} - {f12}
    {shift-f1} - {shift-f12}
    {ctrl-f1} - {ctrl-f12}
    {alt-f1} - {alt-f12}
    {ctrl-a} - {ctrl-z}
    {alt-a} - {alt-z}
    {ctrl-0} - {ctrl-9}
    {esc} {tab} {bksp} {enter}
    {space} {ins} {del}
    {ctrl-esc} {ctrl-tab} {ctrl-bksp} {ctrl-enter}
    {ctrl-space} {ctrl-ins} {ctrl-del}
    {ctrl-prtscr}

 Note that {ctrl-prtscr} is the only flavor of print screen that the bios
 passes through, and so is the only one that can be stuffed.

    {alt-esc} {alt-tab} {alt-bksp} {alt-enter} {alt-space}
    {alt-ins} {alt-del}

 <B>Numeric Keypad Cursor Control Keys</B>

 Please note these keys are found on the numeric keypad.

    {up} {down} {left} {right}
    {home} {end} {pgup} {pgdn}
    {ctrl-up} {ctrl-down} {ctrl-left} {ctrl-right} {ctrl-home} {ctrl-end}
    {ctrl-pgup} {ctrl-pgdn}
    {alt-up} {alt-down} {alt-left} {alt-right} {alt-home} {alt-end}
    {alt-pgup} {alt-pgdn}

 <B>Extended Cursor Control Keys</B>

 These keys correspond to the separate gray keys found on 101/102 key
 extended keyboards. The * character indicates these gray keys:

    {*ins} {*del} {*end} {*pgup} {*pgdn} {*home}
    {*up} {*down} {*right} {*left}
    {ctrl-*ins} {ctrl-*del} {ctrl-*end} {ctrl-*pgup} {ctrl-*pgdn} {ctrl-*home}
    {ctrl-*up} {ctrl-*down} {ctrl-*right} {ctrl-*left}
    {alt-*ins} {alt-*del} {alt-*end} {alt-*pgup} {alt-*pgdn} {alt-*home}
    {alt-*up} {alt-*down} {alt-*right} {alt-*left}

 <B>Numeric Keypad Keys</B>

 Normally, when you specify a number (0-9) as part of an embedded string, the
 keystroke generated will be from the numeric keys along the top of the
 keyboard. If you require to stuff keystrokes from the numeric pad, use the
 following (the # indicates the keystroke is from the numeric pad):

    {#0} {#1} {#2} {#3} {#4} {#5}
    {#6} {#7} {#8} {#9} {#.}
    {#/} {#*} {#-} {#+} {#enter}
    {ctrl-#0} {ctrl-#1} {ctrl-#2} {ctrl-#3} {ctrl-#4}
    {ctrl-#5} {ctrl-#6} {ctrl-#7} {ctrl-#8} {ctrl-#9}
    {ctrl-#.} {ctrl-#/} {ctrl-#*} {ctrl-#-} {ctrl-#+} {ctrl-#enter}
    {alt-#0} {alt-#1} {alt-#2} {alt-#3} {alt-#4}
    {alt-#5} {alt-#6} {alt-#7} {alt-#8} {alt-#9}
    {alt-#.} {alt-#/} {alt-#*} {alt-#-} {alt-#+} {alt-#enter}

 You may separate strings and non-ASCII key combinations with spaces. eg:

    <B>x = SWPKEYBRD(" &lt;tab&gt; 'Testing...' &lt;enter&gt;" )</B>

 <B>International Keyboard Drivers</B>

 Keystrokes supplied to the child process are passed directly from the swap
 kernel, bypassing any international keyboard driver that may be loaded. This
 has the effect of making the keys appear to have come from a US keyboard.
 The international keyboard handler will regain control, as soon as
 SWPKEYBRD() has stuffed all its keystrokes.

 <B>Keystroke Translation</B>

 There are two different types of BIOS call that a program may use to read
 the keyboard, one type is for 'standard' keystrokes, and the other is for
 'extended keystrokes'. SWPKEYBRD() will automatically provide the correct
 keycode for the BIOS call used.

 <B>Clearing the keyboard buffer</B>

 By default, SWPKEYBRD() fools the child program into thinking that the
 keyboard buffer has been cleared between each keystroke. This will make key
 stuffing operate more reliably with programs that clear the keyboard buffer
 on a regular basis (and would otherwise cause subsequent stuffed keystrokes
 to be lost). This behaviour can be changed using the function SWPKEYCLR().

 <B>How SWPKEYBRD() works</B>

 The string that is passed to SWPKEYBRD() is immediately translated into the
 equivalent sequence of keystrokes. When SWPRUNCMD() is called to execute the
 child program, the swap kernel (that part of SWPRUNCMD() that remains in
 memory during the swap), takes over the BIOS keyboard interrupt, and feeds
 these keycodes into the child program in response to BIOS calls made by the
 child program (or DOS), as if they were coming directly from the keyboard.
 Once all keys have been stuffed, the kernel allows normal keyboard input to
 be passed through to the child program.

 Most  programs that use either DOS or BIOS function calls to read keyboad
 input should be controllable by SWPKEYBRD().

 <B>Creating a text file using a popular text editor</B>

 This example stuffs the first line, followed by the {enter} key, then the
 second line, followed by another {enter}. Next the file is saved by stuffing
 {alt-f} (file menu) and then 's' (save), finally the editor is exited with
 {alt-x}.

    <B>keystr := " 'Mary had a little lamb,' {enter} "</B>
    <B>keystr := keystr + ' "It's fleece was ..." {enter}'</B>
    <B>keystr := keystr + "{alt-f}'s'{alt-x}"</B>
    <B>swpkeybrd(keystr)</B>
    <B>swpruncmd("EDIT MARY",0,"","")</B>

 <B>Entering data into a (fictitious) spreadsheet program</B>

 This example stuffs the keyboard movements, enters the data, recalculates,
 saves and quitts the spreadsheet.

    <B>keystr = "{down}{down}{right}{right}"</B>
    <B>keystr = keystr + " '2.75'{enter}"</B>
    <B>keystr = keystr + " '!' {enter} "</B>
    <B>keystr = keystr + " '/s' {enter} '/x' {enter} "</B>
    <B>SWPKEYBRD(keystr)</B>
    <B>SWPRUNCMD("SS TEST",0,"","")</B>
