 <B>DOS Extender Settings</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>/DTnnn (dual mode threshold)</B>

 This setting allows the dual mode threshold specified at link time to be
 overridden. This can also be used during testing to force the program to run
 in real mode by setting /DT20000 (or some suitably large figure). See the
 BLINKER EXECUTABLE DUAL command for more details.

 <B>/EBnnn (extended memory block size)</B>

 This setting controls the size of the memory blocks allocated by the
 extender from the host. The default size is 256KB. See the BLINKER EXTMEM
 BLOCK command for more details.

 <B>/ED+ and /ED- (extender debugging)</B>

 This setting enables and disables certain debugging messages provided by the
 extender, such as checking for aliasing of segments which are not locked or
 not present, and freeing of selectors using a free memory function call. It
 is advisable to test your programs running under a VCPI or XMS host (ie not
 DPMI) with this option enabled to check for these circumstances. The default
 is disabled.

 <B>/EInnn[,nnn] (extender IPX buffers)</B>

 This setting specifies the number of IPX ecb buffers, and optionally the
 number of IPX send buffers, allocated by the extender's IPX module. See the
 BLINKER EXECUTABLE IPX command for more details.

 <B>/EK+ and /EK- (extender keyboard handling)</B>

 This setting enables and disables special handling of certain keyboard BIOS
 calls by the extender to prevent needless mode switching. When enabled, this
 option can increase the performance of serial communications routines. When
 disabled, this option may improve compatability with old TSRs which
 manipulate the keyboard. The default is disabled.

 <B>/ELnnnn (extended memory limit)</B>

 This setting specifies the total amount of host memory that the extender
 will allocate before the extender's VM system begins to swap to disk in
 order to satisfy new allocation requests. This setting can be used to limit
 the amount of host memory used, or to simulate running in lower memory
 conditions. See the BLINKER EXTMEM LIMIT command for more details.

 <B>/ETnnnn (extended memory threshold)</B>

 This setting allows the extended mode threshold specified at link time to be
 overridden. See the BLINKER EXECUTABLE EXTENDED command for more details.

 <B>/HD+ and /HD- (host DPMI)</B>

 This setting enables and disables the use of a DPMI host. See the BLINKER
 HOST DPMI command for more details.

 <B>/HM+ and /HM- (host messages)</B>

 This setting enables and disables the displaying of status messages at
 program start up. See the BLINKER HOST QDPMI command documented above for
 more details. The default is disabled.

 <B>/HP+ and /HP- (host passup)</B>

 This setting enables or disables the Blinker extender's automatic pass up of
 IRQ interrupts from real mode to protected mode. This setting should only be
 necessary for debugging purposes when testing interrupt handlers. See also
 the BLINKER HOST PASSUP command. The default is enabled.

 <B>/HQ+ and /HQ- (host QDPMI)</B>

 This setting enables and disables the use of the Quarterdeck QDPMI host. See
 the BLINKER HOST QDPMI command for more details.

 <B>/HV+ and /HV- (host VCPI)</B>

 This setting enables and disables the use of a VCPI host. See the BLINKER
 HOST VCPI command for more details.

 <B>/HX+ and /HX- (host XMS)</B>

 This setting enables and disables the use of an XMS host. See the BLINKER
 HOST XMS command for more details.

 <B>/LRnnn (lowmem reserve)</B>

 This setting specifies the amount of conventional memory reserved for
 program use, preventing Blinker's DOS extender from using it for other
 purposes. See the BLINKER LOWMEM RESERVE command for more details.

 <B>/WS+ and /WS- (Windows Soft-Ice)</B>

 This setting enables or disables the extender's check for the presence of
 the Soft-Ice/W debugger in protected mode running in a Windows enhanced mode
 DOS box. The default is enabled.
