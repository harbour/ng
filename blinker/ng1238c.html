 <B>BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH       Specify maximum depth of CA-Clipper procedure nesting</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify the maximum depth of CA-Clipper procedure nesting</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH &lt;nuDepth&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>50</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Increase stack size for 3rd party libraries</B></U>
            <B>BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH 60</B>

 This command is provided as a convenience to CA-Clipper programmers to allow
 the setting of the program stack based on the maximum procedure nesting
 depth which will occur in the application at runtime. This depth is the
 number of procedure calls that are executed before a procedure return. For
 example, if procedure A calls procedure B which calls procedure C, the
 maximum depth is 3. But, if procedure B returns to procedure A which then
 calls procedure C, the maximum depth is 2.

 The default depth is 50 procedures, but this may be increased if it is
 possible for more nesting to occur. For instance, a recursive procedure (one
 that calls itself) will often require a greater depth. The size of the stack
 set is approximately 1kb per 10 levels. Thus the default of 50 procedures
 has an overhead of approximately 5kb, and this will rise proportionally as
 the PROCEDURE DEPTH is increased.

 Since both this command and the STACK command control the size of the
 application stack, only one of these commands should be used (the last one
 specified is the one that is processed). Programmers using languages other
 than CA-Clipper should use the STACK command directly, since the calculation
 that Blinker performs to compute the final stack size with this command is
 based on the stack requirements for CA-Clipper procedures.

 Blinker can only check the stack when executing overlaid code. However, some
 applications making use of third party libraries linked into the root,
 especially in a network environment, may require an increase in the
 PROCEDURE DEPTH. Symptoms indicating this include erratic hanging of the
 machine, spurious characters on the screen and other fatal errors which do
 not happen regularly.
