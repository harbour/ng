 <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION MINUTES Specify number of minutes for demonstration version </B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify number of minutes for demonstration version</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION MINUTES &lt;nuLimit&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Set the limit on length of program execution</B></U>
            <B>BLINKER DEMONSTRATION MINUTES 20</B>

 This command is used to set the number of minutes of program runtime before
 it will end with the 'demonstration minutes limit exceeded' message. It may
 be set to any number from 1 minute to 65535 minutes.

 This can be used to create a demonstration version of the program without
 having to modify the source code. When the specified time limit is reached,
 the error handling procedure BLERRPRG is called with error number 1209,
 indicating that the demonstration minutes limit has been exceeded.

 The source for this error handler is provided should you want to modify the
 text of the termination message.

 Note: The demonstration restrictions are only checked when overlays are
 loaded, so to use them please ensure that at least one function or procedure
 which is called regularly is overlaid. To be sure that overlays exist, be
 aware that any overlaid segment that is smaller than the BLINKER OVERLAY
 THRESHOLD default of 32 bytes will automatically be removed from the overlay
 area.

 The function BLIDEMMIN() allows the limit to be extended from within the
 program. Please see the appropriate section in Chapter 10 for more details.

 <B>CA-Clipper 5.x note:</B>

 To include Blinker's overlay manager in the application, some non-CA-Clipper
 code must be overlaid, for example EXTEND.LIB.
