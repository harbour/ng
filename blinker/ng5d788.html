 <B>Problems when debugging</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Blinker error 1203</B>

 Some debuggers require exclusive access to the executable file during
 debugging, which may cause problems with overlaid programs, the usual
 symptom of which is a Blinker error 1203. To alleviate this problem, use the
 Blinker READONLY script command to create the executable with a read only
 attribute, or use the DOS ATTRIB command to set the read only attribute
 following the link.

 When debugging overlaid programs, ensure you are using the current version
 of the vector source file (.VEC), otherwise things may become confusing!

 <B>Overlays and debuggers other than CodeView</B>

 When the overlay manager loads or unloads an overlay, it informs CodeView
 that a section change has occurred. If your debugger, or other utility is
 not fully compatible with CodeView, you may not be able to use it to debug
 overlaid programs, although you should still be able to debug modules in the
 root.
