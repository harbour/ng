 <B>1315: insufficient conventional memory to run program</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the Dual mode program has attempted to load in
 real mode but has found that there is insufficient conventional (DOS) memory
 to do so.

 Free up conventional memory by removing TSRs etc before running this
 program, or refer to the Blinker manual for details of how to overlay more
 code for a real mode program.

 One possible cause of this error is that no overlays have been specified at
 link time, resulting in a large loadsize when the program is executed in
 real mode.
