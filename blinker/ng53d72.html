 <B>1216: overlay manager unable to resume</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that a call to the overlay manager resume function
 BLIOVLRES() has been made, and that the overlay manager was unable to
 re-allocate memory for the overlay pool in order to resume executing
 overlays.

 The probable cause of this message is that subsequent to the call to the
 overlay manager suspend function, BLIOVLSUS(), the memory previously used
 for the overlay pool was allocated to a request for conventional memory and
 still remains allocated. In order to resume, the overlay manager requires an
 area of conventional memory at least as large as the previous overlay pool.
