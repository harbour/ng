 <B>1319: unable to resolve imported name &lt;importname&gt;</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the main EXE or a dependent DLL requested the
 specified imported name but the Blinker DOS extender was unable to resolve
 it from the loaded DLLs.

 This error usually occurs when a DLL has been overwritten with a newer or
 older DLL which does not contain the specified function.

 Locate the DLL in which the imported name is supposed to exist, check that
 it is the correct version, and use an import librarian such as BLILIB.EXE
 (see Chapter 6, .Windows Programs.) to check that it exports the required
 name.
