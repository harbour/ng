 <B>MURPHY                        Create worst case overlay situation</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Create a worst case overlay situation</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>MURPHY</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 The MURPHY command causes the overlay manager to attempt to force any
 inadvertent overlay errors (programming errors) to manifest themselves
 during testing or debugging.

 When MURPHY is enabled, the overlay manager will only allow a single overlay
 to be in memory at any given time, allowing the developer to detect 'badly
 behaved' dependencies between overlays and correct them.

 The overlay manager also fills all unused space in the overlay pool with INT
 3 instructions, with a far jump to an error reporting routine within the
 overlay manager being placed at the very end of the overlay area.

 When the program is run under a debugger, and an erroneous jump to an
 invalid (i.e. non-vectored) address within the overlay area occurs, the INT
 3 instruction will cause the debugger to breakpoint at the offending
 address.

 If the program is not being executed under a debugger, the processor will
 execute all the INT 3 instructions and the far jump to the error routine in
 the overlay manager, at which point the overlay manager will display a
 message and terminate the program.

 The use of the MURPHY command may slow down the execution of the program
 significantly.
