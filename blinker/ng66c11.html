 <B>Linking for protected mode</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 <B>Overview</B>

 When converting a program to protected mode or dual mode the modifications
 to the link script file are minimal. Typically only two extra commands must
 be added to the link file, one to specify that the program is to be DOS
 extended and the other to include the Blinker library for the compiler being
 used.

 Simply adding the command BLINKER EXECUTABLE EXTENDED (BLI EXE EXT) causes
 Blinker to create a DOS extended program. Similarly, adding the command
 BLINKER EXECUTABLE DUAL (BLI EXE DUA) causes Blinker to create a dual mode
 program.

 When linking DOS extended or dual mode programs it is always necessary to
 include an additional Blinker library for the appropriate compiler. This
 library contains replacement .OBJs for any compiler library .OBJs which are
 not protected mode compatible.

 The Blinker libraries all have names of the form BLXcccnn, where ccc
 indicates the vendor and compiler, and nn indicates the compiler version
 number. They are all compiled as large model and so should only be used with
 large model programs.

 The appropriate compiler library must always be SEARCHed just before the
 standard compiler library or the script file containing the compiler
 library.

 For example, with Microsoft Visual C++:

    <B>SEARCH BLXMVC10      # Blinker library</B>
    <B>LIB LLIBCE           # MSVC library</B>

 or with CA-Clipper 5.2:

    <B>SEARCH BLXCLP52      # Blinker library</B>
    <B>LIB CLIPPER          # CA-Clipper library</B>

 or:

    <B>SEARCH BLXCLP52      # Blinker library</B>
    <B>@CL520MID            # Script containing CA-Clipper library</B>

 If the compiler library is not explicitly mentioned then place the SEARCH of
 the Blinker library as the last library in the link file.

 When using third-party libraries please ensure that they are protected mode
 or dual mode compatible before attempting to use them in a DOS extended
 program. Blinkinc cannot guarantee that any particular library is either
 overlayable or protected mode compatible or both. Please refer to the file
 3RDPARTY.DOC for up-to-date details on compatibility issues which we are
 aware of.

 The third party libraries should typically be placed before the SEARCH of
 the Blinker library unless otherwise documented in the third party product.
