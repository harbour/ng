 <B>SWPKEYCLR()                   Alter SWPKEYBRD() behaviour</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Function : <B>Alter SWPKEYBRD() behaviour</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>niValue = SWPKEYCLR(niClearCount)</B></U>

 <U>Return   : <B>The previous setting.</B></U>

 This function alters the number of times that SWPKEYBRD() clears the
 keyboard buffer between stuffing keystrokes into the child process.

 Normally, SWPKEYBRD() indicates to the child program that the keyboard
 buffer is empty between stuffing each keystroke. This prevents loss of
 keystrokes if the child program tries to clear the keyboard buffer itself by
 discarding any pending keystrokes.

 However, under multi-tasking systems, such as DesqView, the operating system
 itself polls the keyboard to detect idle time, and as a result may 'steal'
 the keyboard buffer clear signal that the swap kernel is trying to send to
 the child process. For this reason, the swap kernel sends not one, but 5
 keyboard clear signals between each keystroke, to ensure the child program
 will see at least one of them.

 If you seem to be losing keystrokes, increasing this value through the use
 of this function may help.

 Example:

    <B>SWPKEYCLR(10)        // 10 clears between each key</B>
