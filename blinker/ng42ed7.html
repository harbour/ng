 <B>1010: &lt;filename&gt; : no space available for incremental link</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the named file has become too large to fit in
 the space reserved for it when the last full link was performed. A full link
 will be performed to recreate the application .EXE and its associated
 incremental link file.

 If you receive this message on a regular basis you may wish to increase the
 space left for incremental linking by using the BLINKER INCREMENTAL PAD
 &lt;padsize&gt; command detailed in Chapter 9. Enlarging the padsize will increase
 the ratio of incremental links to full relinks, at the same time it will
 increase the size of the .EXE and its memory requirements during execution.
