 <B>DEFINE                        Specify symbols to be excluded at link time</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify symbols to be excluded at link time</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>DEFINE &lt;symbol&gt;[, &lt;symbol&gt; ...]</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>DEFINE Alpha, Beta</B></U>

 The DEFINE command is used to 'stub out' the named symbols and point them to
 a dummy routine in the overlay manager. Instead of including the modules
 containing the named symbols in the final .EXE file, Blinker maps each
 DEFINEd symbol to a routine within the overlay manager which will display
 the runtime error 1213 if the routine is ever called. This command can be
 used (with care) to prevent routines which you know will never be called
 from being linked in.

 Note that in order to prevent a module from being linked in you must DEFINE
 all its public symbols.

 Take care to ensure that only code symbols are stubbed using DEFINE. If
 DEFINEd data items are written to, the overlay manager may be corrupted.

 Please note that when MIXCASE is mentioned prior to DEFINE commands the
 symbols named will be processed as case sensitive.
