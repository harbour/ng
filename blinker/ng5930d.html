 <B>Other common errors</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>DOS open error 4</B>

 This is a DOS error that indicates there are no more handles left to open
 another file. Increase the number of file handles in each of three places:

    .  The workstation - FILES=nn in CONFIG.SYS
    .  The network - (SHELL.CFG for Novell)
    .  The program - some C compilers limit the number of file handles in the
       start-up routine.

 Remember that Blinker requires one file handle per overlay: one for an
 internal overlay or when using external overlays one per SECTION INTO
 command. Also, CA-Clipper 5.x requires a corresponding number of file
 handles for the dynamic paging system.

 <B>DOS open error 5</B>

 Particularly for DOS 4.0 and 5.0 where SHARE is automatically loaded, a
 fixed sized table is allocated that will contain the file name and full path
 for each open file. This error often indicates that there is no more room in
 this table to open another file. In this case, execute the DOS SHARE command
 with an enlarged space for the /f parameter.

 <B>Sharing Violation</B>

 Certain networks including 3COM and LANTASTIC encounter sharing violation
 errors with internal overlays when a second copy of the program is loaded.
 This appears to be due to the network requiring exclusive write access to
 the program file when it loads it.

 To circumvent this problem either set the .EXE to read only access by using
 the Blinker command READONLY (or the DOS ATTRIB command) or specify an
 external overlay with the Blinker command SECTION INTO at the start of the
 BEGINAREA in the script file.
