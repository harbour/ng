 <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER    Specify default CLIPPER environment settings</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Specify default CLIPPER environment settings</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER &lt;environment string&gt;</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER //F:35</B></U>

 This command is used to burn default values for the CA-Clipper runtime
 environment variables into the executable file.

 Those settings set using the BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command take
 precedence over those set with the SET CLIPPER command. Parameters not
 specified with the BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command will retain values
 originally assigned by the SET CLIPPER command. However, if you want the
 values in the SET CLIPPER command to take precedence, use the command
 BLINKER ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDE.

 The maximum string length that can be burned into a CA-Clipper application
 is 128 bytes, and Blinker will ignore all but the LAST environment burn-in
 command encountered, so all parameters that are to be burned in should be
 specified in a single BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command.

 PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR BLINKER COMMANDS TAKE EFFECT ONLY
 WHEN A FULL LINK IS EXECUTED.

 The burned-in environment values are not returned by the CA-Clipper
 functions GETE() / GETENV().

 <B>Note for CA-Clipper 5.x:</B>

 The CA-Clipper runtime parameters listed here are applicable to CA-Clipper
 5.x. Check the latest CA-Clipper documentation for a complete list of these
 parameters, correct syntax and default values.

    E:nnnn            Expanded Memory (in kb)
    F:nnn             Number of files
    X:nn              eXclude memory in kb
    BADCACHE          protect the EMS pageframe
    CGACURS           disable EGA cursor
    DYNF:nn           number of handles for dynamic paging
    NOIDLE            disable background garbage collection
    SWAPK:nnnn        size of disk swap file
    SWAPPATH:'path'   path for swap file
    TEMPPATH:'path'   path for temporary files

 CA-Clipper 5.x environment settings can always be overridden (regardless of
 the BLINKER ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDE setting) on the application command line,
 using the command line switch '//' as in:

    <B>MYAPP //SWAPPATH:'D:\'</B>

 which would cause CA-Clipper to create the VMM swapfile in the root of drive
 D:.

 There is usually no reason to disable expanded memory support (E0) for
 CA-Clipper 5.x applications.

 <B>Note for CA-Clipper Summer '87:</B>

 The CA-Clipper runtime settings are detailed in Chapter 9 - The Runtime
 Environment - of the CA-Clipper Summer '87 manual.

 They consist of 6 values:

    Ennn     Expanded memory (in kb)
    Fnnn     Number of open files
    Rnnn     Run command / index memory (in kb)
    Sn       Snow indicator
    Vnnn     Variable table area (in kb)
    Xnnn     eXclude memory (in kb)

 For example, to ensure that 41 files are available to CA-Clipper and that
 100kb will be available to run external commands, use the following command:

    <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER F41;R100</B>

 Remember that for the application to be able to use 41 file handles,
 corresponding values have to be set in the CONFIG.SYS, and, if necessary, in
 the appropriate network configuration.

 At runtime, using the above burned-in settings, the 'F' and 'R' parameters
 in the CLIPPER environment will be ignored, but all the other parameters
 will be used in the normal way. It should be noted that the CLIPPER
 environment variable should be used to disable expanded memory usage by
 CA-Clipper Summer '87. If this is not done index files may be corrupted when
 CA-Clipper Summer '87 uses this memory in conjunction with certain expanded
 memory drivers, or RUN errors may occur. To disable CA-Clipper Summer '87
 usage of expanded memory set the CLIPPER environment variable 'E' to 0 as
 follows (this may be used in conjunction with the other settings for number
 of files etc.):

    <B>SET CLIPPER=E0</B>

 Alternatively, the E0 may be burned into the application:

    <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER E0</B>
