 <B>1118: too many external overlays</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that more than 15 unique external overlay file names
 were specified in the link script file.

 This version of Blinker only supports up to 15 external overlays. It should
 be noted that with Blinker's dynamic overlaying, the only reason to have
 more than one external overlay file is so that each overlay file will fit
 onto a 360kb diskette, if required for distribution purposes.

 For a full description of external overlays see the command SECTION INTO in
 Chapter 9.
