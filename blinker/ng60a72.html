 <B>4.3 New error messages</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>1016 : ignoring duplicate import for symbol &lt;symbol&gt;</B>

 This message indicates that a duplicate import definition for the specified
 symbol has been encountered but ignored.

 <B>1017 : ignoring duplicate definition for segment &lt;segment&gt;</B>

 This message indicates that a duplicate segment definition for the specified
 segment name has been encountered but ignored.

 <B>1018 : unable to export symbol &lt;symbol&gt;</B>

 This message indicates that an export definition for the specified symbol
 has been encountered but the symbol does not exist in the program so the
 export definition was ignored.

 <B>1150: &lt;filename&gt; is a demo so cannot be linked with this Blinker</B>

 This message indicates that the specified library is a special demonstration
 library which can only be linked with a demonstration version of Blinker.
 The demonstration version of Blinker should have been supplied along with
 the demonstration library.

 <B>1151: increase PACKDATA parameter to reduce SYMBOLs segments</B>

 This message indicates that there were too many SYMBOLs segments in an
 incrementally linked CA-Clipper program, so it is necessary to increase (or
 add) the parameter to the PACKDATA link script file command.

 <B>1152: too many exported name symbols</B>

 This message indicates that the .EXE or .DLL file being created contains too
 many exported name symbols to be placed in the .EXE header.

 Either remove some EXPORT commands from the module definition file or remove
 one or more import libraries from the link script file.

 <B>1153: 4.0 requires a more recent version of BLXxxxnnn.LIB</B>

 This message indicates that the indicated library is from an older version
 of Blinker.

 Check that the link script file and the LIB environment path point to the
 latest version of the indicated library.

 <B>1317: extender heap full</B>

 This message indicates that the Blinker DOS extender heap has been
 completely used up, and should not occur in normal operation.

 It usually indicates that a large number of small allocations of memory have
 been made directly via the extender API, which in turn is usually caused by
 repeated allocation of a temporary buffer without it being freed each time.

 Check the program for endless recursion or failure to free a temporary
 memory allocation in a function which is called repeatedly.

 <B>1318: divide by zero attempted at (nn) ssss:oooo</B>

 This message indicates that the code in .EXE segment nn at address ssss:oooo
 executed an integer divide instruction with a divisor of zero and a divide
 by zero handler had not been installed.
