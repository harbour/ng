 <B>MAP                           Request segment map of executable</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>Request a segment map of the executable</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>MAP [=[d:][path]&lt;filename&gt;] [S][,A]]</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 <U>Example  : <B># Generate a map of all public symbols</B></U>
            <B>MAP=C:\TEMP\Mymap A</B>

 The MAP command is used to specify to the linker that a map file of the
 linked .EXE file is required. The map file defaults to the same name as the
 .EXE file with an extension of .MAP, or the name can be specified in the MAP
 command. The map file can be listed with varying levels of detail, as
 required.

 The two options to the command are as follows:

 S - All segments - lists the address, length and name of each segment in the
 executable image. This is the default option, if none is specified.

 A - Public symbols in address order - lists the public symbols and their
 memory addresses. The A option can be used to produce a map file which can
 be used for debugging C and Assembler programs using debuggers which do not
 support CodeView information. The Turbo Debugger is not included in this
 category since the Borland TDCONVRT utility allows the Turbo Debugger to
 make full use of CodeView format .EXE files.

 For a discussion of the output generated by the MAP command see Appendix A.
