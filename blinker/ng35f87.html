 <B>SWPADDENV()                   Increase size of child environment block.</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Function : <B>Increase size of child environment block.</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>niValue = SWPADDENV(NumberOfBytes)</B></U>

 <U>Return   : <B>The previous setting</B></U>

 By default, when the DOS EXEC function starts a process (SWPRUNCMD()

 uses this DOS function), the environment that is created for the child is
 truncated so that there is very little, if any, free space.

 This function can be used to increase the size of the child program's
 environment by the number of bytes passed as a parameter. This is necessary
 if the program (or batch file) that will be run as a child process needs to
 add or change environment variables. The maximum size of an environment
 block is 32 KB.

 Note that this function increases the size of the child environment at the
 time the child process is executed, it does not modify the parent
 environment in any way.

 The child environment is destroyed when the child process terminates.

 Example:

    <B>// Ensure 128 bytes free in environment</B>
    <B>OldSize = SWPADDENV(128)</B>
