 <B>BLINKER Programming Functions</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Function Overview</B>

 Blinker features a number of functions which provide the program developer
 with increased control over the runtime overlay environment and additional
 debugging information. All Blinker functions used by your program are
 automatically linked without the need to specify any additional libraries.
 Blinker functions can only be used in Blinker linked programs.

 All the functions which produce output take a file handle as an optional
 parameter, and all output from the function will be sent to that file
 handle. The handle is not validated, and should be either 1, to send output
 to the screen, 2 to send output to the standard error device, 4 to send
 output to the printer, or the handle of a file opened by the program.

 The default handle may be set at link time using the BLINKER DEBUG HANDLE
 command or in the program using the Debug Handle function (BLIDBGHAN())
 detailed below. If no handle is specified then the output is sent to DOS
 file handle 1 (the screen).

 <B>Naming Conventions</B>

 Assembler programmers note: when calling from assembler you should prepend
 an underbar character to the function names in order to comply with C naming
 conventions.

 BASIC programmers note: Blinker functions called from BASIC which receive
 string parameters or return string values have a different function name -
 the letters 'BAS' are appended to the normal nine character function name.
 For example, the BASIC version of BLIDEMDTE() is called BLIDEMDTEBAS().

 <B>Notational Conventions</B>

 Many of the functions provided by Blinker can be accessed from several
 languages, using the standard C calling conventions.

 Blinker provides specific interfaces for the C language, Microsoft Basic PDS
 &amp; QuickBasic, and for CA-Clipper Summer '87 and 5.01. If you are using a
 language not mentioned here, it is likely that your compiler can be directed
 to use the C calling convention to access Blinker functions. Consult your
 compiler documentation for further information on mixed language
 programming.

 The tables on the following pages detail the notational convention used to
 describe the types of parameters and return values, and the appropriate data
 types for each calling convention.

 Each parameter, (or return value) is preceded by a two letter prefix
 denoting the type of the value, which also implies the way the parameter is
 passed to the function.

 <B>Parameter type conventions</B>

 The following tables show the data types used as parameters and return
 values from all Blinker functions. The prefixes have the following meanings:

    ni numeric     signed integer    (signed word)
    nu numeric     unsigned integer  (unsigned word)
    nl numeric     long integer      (signed dword)
    c  character   string            (byte pointer)
    l  logical     (boolean)         (word)

 For each language listed in the table (CA-Clipper, Basic, and C) the
 language declaration for each type is given (no type declaration is needed
 in the CA-Clipper language, but the passed parameters must be of the correct
 type).

 Logical (or boolean) values are only directly supported for CA-Clipper. All
 other languages should use the numeric integer type, passing a zero value to
 indicate false, and a non zero value to indicate true. Return values from
 the functions use the same convention.

 For languages not listed, use the data types which match the C types.

 <B>Calling conventions</B>

 The Blinker functions are provided with interfaces to most languages, and
 these are defined in the language include files BLINKER.BI, BLINKER.H,
 BLINKER.CH, BLINKER.FI, BLINKER.HDR, BLINKER.DEF and BLINKER.INC,. These
 files can be found in the BAS, C, CLP, FOR, FRC, MOD and PAS subdirectories
 respectively of the Blinker installation directory.

 The CA-Clipper interface uses the CA-Clipper extend system, and requires no
 special treatment as far as the CA-Clipper programmer is concerned.

 The BASIC interface is identical to the C interface for simple data types,
 but strings require special treatment. For this reason, any of the Blinker
 functions which pass or return string values have the suffix 'BAS' appended
 to the normal function name.

 The C interface uses the following calling conventions:

    .  Simple data types are passed on the stack
    .  Strings are passed by far reference
    .  Parameters are passed in reverse order, ie the last parameter is
       pushed onto the stack first.

 which are the same as standard C calling conventions.

 Languages for which no interface is provided should use the C interface.
