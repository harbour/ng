 <B>CODEVIEW                      CodeView debugger support</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <U>Purpose  : <B>CodeView debugger support</B></U>

 <U>Syntax   : <B>CODEVIEW</B></U>

 <U>Default  : <B>Disabled</B></U>

 The CODEVIEW command globally and retroactively enables the processing of
 CodeView debugging information, regardless of the position of the CODEVIEW
 statement in the link script file. The CODEVIEW command is identical in
 effect to a CVON command at the beginning of the link script.

 Developers with large overlaid programs may see some performance degradation
 of their overlaid code whilst running under the CodeView debugger if the
 CODEVIEW command has been used. If performance is an issue under these
 circumstances, it is recommended to use the CVON and CVOFF commands to
 create CodeView areas which selectively enable debugging information for
 specific files, modules or libraries.

 The default version of CodeView information added to the .EXE file is 0 for
 maximum compatibility with other debuggers. Later versions may be selected
 using the CVVERSION command. (For more details, see the section on CVVERSION
 in Chapter 9.)

 Note: External overlays are required in order to use this command.
