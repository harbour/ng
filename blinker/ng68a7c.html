 <B>Example of a .DEF file</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 <B>A typical module definition file</B>

    <B>NAME              MYPROG</B>
    <B>DESCRIPTION       `Myprog Version 1.00'</B>
    <B>EXETYPE           WINDOWS</B>
    <B>STUB              `WINSTUB.EXE'</B>
    <B>CODE              PRELOAD MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE</B>
    <B>DATA              PRELOAD MOVEABLE MULTIPLE</B>
    <B>HEAPSIZE          1024</B>
    <B>STACKSIZE         8192</B>

 NAME sets a name for the program. It is usually the same name as the
 executable file.

 DESCRIPTION allows a descriptive character string to be embedded in the
 program.

 EXETYPE specifies which operating system the program will be running under.

 STUB adds a DOS stub named `WINSTUB.EXE' to the beginning of the program.

 CODE sets the default attributes of code segments. PRELOAD indicates that
 the segment is loaded when the program starts. MOVEABLE determines whether a
 segment can be moved in memory. DISCARDABLE determines whether a code
 segment can be discarded from memory to fill a different memory request.

 DATA sets the default attributes of data segments. PRELOAD and MOVEABLE are
 as defined above.

 MULTIPLE specifies that DGROUP is copied for each instance of the program.

 <B>To make a Windows .EXE four steps are required:</B>

 Compile the source code for Windows, as directed in your compiler manual.

 Run the resource compiler to create any resources required, as directed in
 your compiler manual.

 Run Blinker against the link script file and optional module definition
 file.

 Run the resource compiler to add the resources to the end of the .EXE file.
