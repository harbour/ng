 <B>1104: unbalanced BEGINAREAs and ENDAREAs</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that a different number of BEGINAREA and ENDAREA
 commands was found in the script file(s), which implies an invalid overlay
 structure. Generally only one BEGINAREA and ENDAREA section is needed for
 Blinker's dynamic overlays. If an overlay structure is being carried over
 from a structured linker, this can be simplified by reducing the number of
 overlay sections.
