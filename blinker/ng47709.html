 <B>1120: incremental link file is too large</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This message indicates that the incremental link file created by Blinker has
 exceeded the maximum allowable size.

 The simplest way to reduce the size of the incremental link file is to place
 CA-Clipper .OBJ files which are rarely changed into a library file using a
 librarian such as MS LIB. This reduces the incremental link file size as
 incremental information is not stored for library files.

 Alternatively, .CLP files can be used to create larger .OBJs, but the
 compile and link cycle would be slowed down because of the extra compile
 time.
