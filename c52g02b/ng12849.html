 <B>ert0004 Duplicate stacks</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  Two different stacks are requested by a program.  The
     most probable cause is that you have written a program in assembly
     language that has direct control over allocation of stack segments.

     <B>Action:</B>  The solution is to eliminate the allocation of one of the
     stack segments.  The SS and SP registers can be moved once your program
     begins execution, but the linker needs to identify a single stack
     segment so that it can know how to initialize the registers in the .EXE
     header.
