 <B>ert0011 PRELOAD command must have active section</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The FREEFORMAT PRELOAD command specifies that an
     overlay section should be loaded into its overlay area during program
     startup, and the command must occur after the SECTION specification for
     the section which is to be preloaded.  This error indicates that the
     current section is the root section which is, in effect, always
     preloaded, but never handled by the overlay manager.  It is, therefore,
     an error to mark the root section as preloaded.

     <B>Action:</B>  Move the PRELOAD command to somewhere after the SECTION
     specification for the overlay section you want to preload.
