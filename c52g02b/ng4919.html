 <B>C2013   EXIT statement violates enclosing SEQUENCE</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You specified an EXIT statement between BEGIN SEQUENCE
     and RECOVER statements without an enclosing  DO WHILE or FOR loop.  This
     could happen for several reasons:

     1. You specified an EXIT statement with no enclosing DO WHILE or FOR
        control structure within a SEQUENCE.

     2. You are attempting to EXIT from a DO WHILE or FOR control structure
        enclosing the current SEQUENCE from within the SEQUENCE.

     <B>Action:</B>

     1. Check to determine if you omitted the DO WHILE or FOR control
        structure statements.  If so, add the control structure statements.

     2. Check to determine if you intended to EXIT from a control structure
        enclosing the current SEQUENCE.  If so, you must BREAK to the RECOVER
        or the END statements and then EXIT.

     3. Remove the offending EXIT statement.
