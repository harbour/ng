 <B>BASE/1004    No exported method</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>

     1. You sent a message using the send operator (:), but the left operand
        was not a reference to an object or the receiving object has no
        method with the specified name.

     2. You called the EVAL() function and did not pass a code block as the
        first argument.

     3. You specified a value other than a code block in a context where a
        code block was required.

     <B>Action:</B>

     1. Check to make sure that the value being operated on is of the proper
        type or class.

     2. If the error occurs on the send operator (:), make sure the message
        is one of the messages defined for the class.

     3. If the missing method is "EVAL," make sure that code blocks have been
        supplied where required.
