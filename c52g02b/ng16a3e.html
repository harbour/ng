 <B>eut0006 Need to swap but nothing is on the swap list</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  There is not enough memory to run the link.  Memory
     management within .RTLink is handled in such a way that it can run in
     very tight memory situations by swapping data that is not currently
     needed out to a swap file.  However, information which is being
     currently acted on must be in memory.  This message indicates that there
     is not enough free memory to keep even the minimum information in
     memory.

     <B>Action:</B>  If you get this error, try to free up more memory.
