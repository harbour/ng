 <B>ert0005 filename portion of output file '&lt;filename&gt;' too long (max length</B>
         <B>&lt;maximum length of output filename&gt;)</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You entered an output filename that is too long for
     the linker to handle.  The number displayed as the maximum length is the
     number of characters (in decimal) which can be given.

     <B>Action:</B>  Reduce the length of the filename as indicated. Keep in
     mind that only the first eight characters are meaningful as a DOS
     filename.  The linker is not restricting how you name your files, but
     there is a limit on how many extra characters it will carry along for
     displaying in error messages.
