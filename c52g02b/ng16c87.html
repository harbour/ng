 <B>eut0007 Cannot open work file '&lt;filename&gt;'</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that .RTLink cannot open the
     indicated temporary work file.  Normally, a failure in opening a work
     file indicates that you do not have permission to either read from or
     write to the named file or its directory.  Other disk problems, such as
     a corrupted disk, could also lead to this failure, but they are far less
     likely to occur.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make sure you have read and write permission for the named
     file and that you have permission to create a file in the indicated
     directory.
