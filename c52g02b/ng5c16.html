 <B>C2021   Redefinition of CA-Clipper procedure or function</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You specified a PROCEDURE or FUNCTION declaration for
     a procedure or function name already declared within the same scope.
     Procedures and functions in CA-Clipper are either public (visible to all
     other routines in a program) or static (visible only to routines
     declared within the same program file).

     <B>Action:</B>  This error usually is generated because of a name conflict
     between two public functions.  If both functions are indeed public
     functions, rename one of them.  If either or both could be STATIC,
     declare them accordingly.
