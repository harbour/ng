 <B>wrt0003 memory model mismatch in COMENT record ('&lt;model known before&gt;' !=</B>
         <B>'&lt;model encountered&gt;', COMENT record at 0x&lt;offset, file '&lt;file&gt;'</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  There are many types of COMENT records which provide
     descriptive information about the object but do not usually affect the
     output of a linker.  These records are similar to a comment which you
     might place in a source file.  One type of COMENT record is a memory
     model specification that does not affect the running of .RTLink.

     The message indicates that the data portion of this COMENT record did
     not match the data in these records which the linker encountered
     previously.  Since the format of this particular COMENT record is
     unpublished, and since many compiler manufacturers embed more
     information than just the memory model in this record (compiler version
     numbers seem to affect the data also), the condition is not normally an
     error.  The message is displayed only to let you know that the data in
     these records differ.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make sure that the objects and libraries which you are
     linking together are of the same memory model.  If you are sure that
     they are, ignore the warning.
