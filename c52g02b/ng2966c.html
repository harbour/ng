 <B>415     Cannot open overlay file</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This error occurs when a CA-Clipper application cannot
     find or cannot open an overlay file.  Overlay files include executable
     (.EXE) files (in the case of dynamic overlays), prelinked library (.pll)
     files, and static overlay (.ovl) files.

     <B>Action:</B>  Probably the most common cause of this error is
     insufficient file handles available to the CA-Clipper application.  The
     first step in trying to solve this problem is to increase the number of
     file handles available to the application, refer to the Files and
     Buffers section in The Runtime Environment chapter of the Programming
     and Utilities guide.

     If insufficient file handles is not the problem, it is possible that the
     CA-Clipper application cannot find the file it is trying to open.  Refer
     to Specifying the Location of Executable Files section in The Runtime
     Environment chapter of the Programming and Utilities guide.
