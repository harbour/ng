 <B>wrt0004 Duplicate start address (using the first one we saw on this level)</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  Some languages specify a start address for the program
     in each object module that makes up the program.  The start address
     associated with the first object encountered is used as the start
     address of the program.  This message lets you know that multiple
     definitions of a start address were encountered and that the start
     address specified by the module which is currently being processed will
     be ignored.

     <B>Action:</B>  If a start address was defined in a referenced .PLL and the
     linker encounters a start address in the object code, the start address
     in the object code will override the start address associated with the
     .PLL.  You can use the VERBOSE option to see just which file .RTLink was
     processing when the warning occurred.
