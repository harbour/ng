     This section is a summary of error messages possible when linking with
     .RTLink.  The messages are divided into categories according to severity
     and the point in the linking process where the error occurs.  Each
     category is described below, followed by a list of all messages in each
     category.  For specific information on the syntax and operation of the
     linker, see The CA-Clipper Linker--RTLINK.EXE chapter in the Programming
     and Utilities guide.

     The listed linker error and warning messages are a subset of all the
     possible messages the linker can display and represent the most likely
     problems that will be encountered during linking.

 <B>.RTLink Warning Messages</B>

     As a category, .RTLink warnings are less severe than errors. They
     indicate potential errors when the program is executed but do not
     prevent the generation of the executable file (.EXE).  The DOS return
     code is set to 1 by the unresolved symbol warning (wrt0022) when
     generating an .EXE file; otherwise, the return code is unaffected by
     warnings.

     The general format of an .RTLink warning message is as follows:

     <B>warning wrtxxxx: messagetext</B>

 <B>.RTLink Error Messages</B>

     .RTLink error messages identify problems such as the inability to find a
     file needed by the linker, a syntax error on the RTLINK.EXE command
     line, or an .OBJ or .LIB file error.  The linker usually cannot continue
     until the error is corrected, and no executable file is generated.  When
     this happens, the DOS return code is set to 1.

     The general format of an .RTLink error message is as follows:

     <B>error ertxxxx: messagetext</B>

 <B>.RTLink Miscellaneous Error Messages</B>

     Miscellaneous errors are just like other .RTLink errors.  The linker
     usually cannot continue until the error is corrected, and no executable
     file (.EXE) is generated.  The DOS return code is set to 1.

     The general format of an .RTLink miscellaneous error message is as
     follows:

     <B>error eutxxxx: messagetext</B>
