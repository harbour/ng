 <B>eut0009 Write of &lt;number&gt; chars to work file &lt;filename&gt; at position</B>
         <B>&lt;position&gt; returns &lt;number&gt;</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that .RTLink cannot write to
     the given position in the indicated temporary work file. Normally, this
     message is caused by a lack of available disk space when .RTLink
     attempts to extend the size of the work file in order to save additional
     data to it.  Other disk problems, such as a corrupted disk, could also
     lead to this failure, but they are far less likely to occur.

     <B>Action:</B>  If you get this message, the work file has already been
     opened for both reading and writing indicating that you have acceptable
     permissions to access the work file.  Make sure that you have at least
     &lt;position&gt; + &lt;number&gt; bytes of available disk space.  You may need much
     more disk space than the error message indicates.
