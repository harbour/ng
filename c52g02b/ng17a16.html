     <B>Explanation:</B>

     1. You attempted to link with one or more Summer '87 compiled object
        modules.  These could be either stand-alone object files (.OBJ) or
        library files (.LIB) containing object modules compiled with Summer
        '87.  The CA-Clipper version of .RTLink is not compatible with Summer
        '87 compiled programs.

     2. You declared a function or procedure twice in the same program.

     3. You attempted to link with a very large object module.

     <B>Action:</B>

     1. If you are upgrading a Summer '87 system to CA-Clipper, recompile all
        program files (.prg) using the CA-Clipper compiler before linking
        with .RTLink the CA-Clipper Linker.  Likewise, if you have library
        files (.LIB) containing Summer '87 generated object modules, rebuild
        the libraries using CA-Clipper generated object files (.OBJ) before
        linking.

     2. If you are maintaining both Summer '87 and CA-Clipper versions of a
        program and libraries, check to see that you are not inadvertently
        linking with Summer '87 object (.OBJ) and library (.LIB) files in the
        current directory, directories referenced by the LIB or OBJ
        environment variables, or directories referenced with the DOS APPEND
        command.

     3. If you declared the function or procedure more than once in the same
        program, remove duplicate declaration and the problem may disappear.

     4. If you have one or more object files (.OBJ) larger than 64K, try
        compiling your (.prg) files individually using the /M compiler
        option.  Make sure to supply all of the resultant .OBJ files to
        .RTLink for linking.  For more information on compiler options and
        linking multiple .OBJ files, refer to the CA-Clipper--CLIPPER.EXE and
        the CA-Clipper Linker--RTLINK.EXE chapters of the Programming and
        Utilities guide.
