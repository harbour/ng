 <B>eut0016 Open of buffered output file '&lt;filename&gt;' failed</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  .RTLink cannot open the indicated output file. .RTLink
     opens the output file for writing.  Normally, a failure in opening the
     output file indicates that you do not have permission to write to the
     named file or its directory.  Other disk problems, such as a corrupted
     disk, could also lead to this failure, but they are far less likely to
     occur.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make sure you have write permission for the named file and
     that you have permission to create a file in the indicated directory.
     If you cannot ensure that the named file will have acceptable
     permissions, specify the name of another file for which you have write
     permission.
