 <B>332     String/array memory overflow</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The maximum capacity of the Segment Virtual Object
     Store (SVOS) system has been exceeded.  Because of the dynamic nature of
     SVOS, it is impossible to state exactly when this error will occur
     &lt;reference to Runtime Memory Management&gt;.  In the worst case this error
     will occur when slightly over a megabyte of strings and/or arrays are in
     use; the best case is in excess of 16 megabytes.

     <B>Action:</B>  This problem can be resolved by reducing the size and/or
     number of strings and arrays that are active at any one time.  Probably
     the most common cause of this error is the declaration of extremely
     large arrays (e.g. LOCAL aArray[500][300]).  Note that every array
     element requires memory to store (even if its value is NIL) and that the
     number of array elements in an array is determined by multiplying the
     number of elements in every dimension and adding the sum of all
     dimensions except for the last.  For example, a 500 by 300 array has
     (500 x 300) + 150,500 elements.

     Because every array element in CA-Clipper requires 14 bytes, this
     amounts to 150,500 x 14 or 2,107,000 bytes -- well in excess of one
     megabyte and therefore potentially dangerous.

     <B>Note: </B> There is no benefit gained by reusing arrays.  CA-Clipper is
     much more efficient when strings and arrays are thrown away and rebuilt
     often rather than kept around unnecessarily for long periods.
