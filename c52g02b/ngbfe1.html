 <B>C3006   Can't create preprocessed output file </B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The compiler cannot create the preprocessed output
     file when the /P command-line option is specified.  This can happen for
     several reasons:

     1. You have run out of file handles.

     2. You have run out of disk space.

     3. You do not have create rights on a network.

     <B>Action:</B>

     1. Increase the number of file handles by changing the FILES statement
        in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Reboot and recompile.

     2. Delete unwanted files from disk and recompile.

     3. Ask your network administrator for create rights in the directory you
        are compiling.
