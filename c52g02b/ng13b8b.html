 <B>ert0028 Cannot find transfer file '&lt;filename&gt;'</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  A .PLT was specified using the PLL option and the
     transfer file (.PLT) associated with that filename cannot be found.  If
     the indicated filename is a full or relative path name, the file could
     not be opened; otherwise, the file was searched for in the current
     directory and in all directories along the PLL and LIB environment
     variables.

     <B>Action:</B>  Verify that the transfer file (.PLT) is present and that
     the name of the prelinked library is specified correctly.
