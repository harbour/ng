 <B>5312    Conventional memory exhausted</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This is an "out of memory" message that indicates that
     the CA-Clipper application no longer has sufficient conventional memory
     available to continue.

     Specifically, this error occurs when the virtual memory system needs to
     swap a virtual memory segment out of conventional memory and it has used
     all expanded memory and disk space that has been made available to it.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make more virtual memory available to the application.
     This can be done by making more expanded memory available by increasing
     the E setting of the CLIPPER environment variable or by making more disk
     space available by increasing the SWAPK setting of the CLIPPER
     environment variable.

     This problem can also be resolved by reducing the size and/or number of
     strings and arrays that are active at any one time.  Probably the most
     common cause of this error is the declaration of extremely large arrays
     (e.g. LOCAL aArray[4096][4096]).  Note that every array element requires
     memory to store (even if its value is NIL) and that the number of array
     elements in an array element requires memory to store (even if its value
     is NIL) and that the number of array elements in an array is determined
     by multiplying the number of elements in every dimension and adding the
     sum of all dimensions except for the last.  For example, a 4096 by 4096
     array as (4096 x 4096) + 4096 or 16,781,312 elements.

     Because every array element in CA-Clipper requires 14 bytes, this
     amounts to 16,781,312 x 14 or 234,938,368 bytes -- well in excess of the
     theoretical capacity of the virtual memory system.

     <B>Note: </B> There is no benefit gained by reusing arrays.  CA-Clipper is
     much more efficient when strings and arrays are thrown away and rebuilt
     often rather than kept around unnecessarily for long periods.
