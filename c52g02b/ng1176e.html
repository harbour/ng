 <B>wrt0011 Public symbol '&lt;symbol&gt;' redefined</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  Redefinition messages are especially important when a
     .PLL is involved.  Often programmers will rewrite a routine in a
     referenced library and not include the new module until they create the
     .EXE.  When a .PLL is built referring to the library and .RTLink needs
     to resolve the name of the routine, it has not seen the new definition
     but needs to find a definition for the symbol.  It would therefore pull
     in the module from the library into the .PLL.  When you later linked the
     .EXE which referenced the .PLL, you would get redefinition messages.
     The addresses in the .PLL have been bound so that they call the library
     function, while the addresses in the .EXE have been bound to reference
     your function.

     <B>Action:</B>  The redefinition of symbols in .RTLink is normally a
     serious error; however, in some instances a knowledgeable programmer may
     ignore this warning if the symbol will never be referenced.  Do this at
     your own risk, however, because in most cases this warning is
     catastrophic.  It implies that occurrences of the symbol may be replaced
     by different addresses in different parts of the program.  Use of the
     EXCLUDE option can often help out with symbol redefinition messages
     (especially when you wish to delay the definition of some symbol in a
     .PLL since the linker will not see the correct definition until .EXE
     link time).
