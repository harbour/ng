 <B>R3021   Error in redirection</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  An error occurred when RMAKE attempted to redirect the
     standard input or output files as specified in an action line.  This
     usually means the output file could not be created or opened.  There may
     not be enough room to create another file in the directory specified, or
     on a network the file was inadvertently deleted by another user.

     <B>Action:</B>  Correct and run the make again.
