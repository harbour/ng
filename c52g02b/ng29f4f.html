 <B>5304    Conventional memory exhausted</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This is an "out of memory" message that indicates that
     the CA-Clipper application no longer has sufficient conventional memory
     available to continue.

     Specifically, this error occurs when a function attempts to allocate
     conventional memory and fails.  This error can be received as a result
     of the failure of _xgrab() in Extend System functions.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make more conventional memory available to the VM system.
     This can be done in several ways:

     <B>.</B>  Increase the amount of conventional memory available before
        running the application (by removing TSRs, making use of a 386 memory
        manager, etc.)

     <B>.</B>  Use a third-party linker that can dynamically overlay C and
        assembly language code.  C and assembly language code is not
        automatically overlaid by .RTLink and therefore sits in conventional
        memory throughout the execution of the application.

     <B>.</B>  Ensure that any C or assembly language code in use is making
        use of the virtual memory system if it is doing dynamic memory
        allocation.  Any memory allocated using the Fixed Memory Allocator
        function (_xalloc() and _xgrab()) reduces the amount of conventional
        memory available if it is not immediately freed.
