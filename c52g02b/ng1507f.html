 <B>ert0055 Cannot seek within library dictionary</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The linker has encountered an error in processing the
     current library.  The library is supposed to have an extended dictionary
     at the end, but a disk seek to the position of the dictionary failed.
     Normally, this indicates a corrupted library.

     <B>Action:</B>  Try running the DOS CHKDSK /F utility to see if your disk
     is corrupted.  If the disk is not corrupted, try regenerating or
     reinstalling the library in question--use the VERBOSE option to see
     which library caused the problem.  If the problem still persists, you
     can work around it by using the NOEXTDICTIONARY option to ignore the
     extended dictionary.
