 <B>wrt0005 No Stack Segment</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message warns you that your program has no stack
     segment defined.  Whether this warning can be ignored or not depends on
     your application.  Normally, only files created by an assembler would
     not have a stack segment.  In advanced languages, this message would
     probably indicate a more serious error.

     <B>Action:</B>  As a general rule, if you are intending to run EXE2BIN with
     the executable file (.EXE), it is normal to see this message.  If,
     however, you plan to run the program as an .EXE, it needs to define a
     stack.
