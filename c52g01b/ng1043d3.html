 <B>Data Type</B>

     (data type) The category of a data value.  A data type is distinguished
     by the set of allowable values for that type, the set of operators that
     can be applied, and the storage format used to represent these values.
     In CA-Clipper, the following data types are defined: character, numeric,
     date, logical, array, object, code block, and NIL.  Program variables
     may contain values of any type.  Database field variables are limited to
     character, numeric, date, logical, and a special type called memo which
     is treated the same as character.
