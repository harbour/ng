------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NOTE [&lt;commentText&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;commentText&gt;</B> is a string of characters placed after the comment
     indicator.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOTE is command synonym for the single-line comment indicator (*).  All
     characters after NOTE are ignored until the CA-Clipper compiler
     encounters an end of line (carriage return/linefeed).  This means a
     single-line comment cannot be continued with the semicolon onto a new
     line.

     If you need a multiline comment, begin the comment block with a
     slash-asterisk (/*) symbol and end the comment block with an
     asterisk-slash (*/) symbol.  If you need to comment out a block of
     code, use the conditional compilation directives #ifdef...#endif
     instead of multiline comments.  This is important since nested comments
     are illegal.

     NOTE is a compatibility command and therefore not recommended.  It is
     superseded by the C-style comment symbols slash-asterisk (/*) and
     asterisk-slash (*/), as well as the double-slash (//).  It is also
     superseded by the dBASE-style comment symbols, asterisk (*) and the
     double-ampersand (&amp;&amp;).

     For a complete discussion on comment indicators, refer to the Basic
     Concepts chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  These examples show the various comment symbols supported by
        CA-Clipper:

        // This is a comment
        /* This is a comment */
        * This is a comment
        &amp;&amp; This is a comment
        NOTE This is a comment
