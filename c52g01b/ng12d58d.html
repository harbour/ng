     <B>HitBottom                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a logical value indicating whether an attempt was made to
        navigate beyond the end of the available data.  TBrowse:HitBottom
        contains true (.T.) if an attempt was made; otherwise it contains
        false (.F.).  During stabilization, the TBrowse object sets this
        variable if TBrowse:SkipBlock indicates it was unable to skip forward
        as many records as requested.

        lLastRec := oTB:HitBottom
