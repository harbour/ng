 <B>REQUEST</B>
 Declare a module request list
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>REQUEST &lt;idModule list&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;idModule list&gt;</B> is the list of modules that will be linked into the
     current executable (.EXE) file.

 <B>Description</B>

     REQUEST is a declaration statement that defines a list of module
     identifiers to the linker.  Like all other declaration statements, a
     REQUEST statement must be specified before any executable statements in
     either the program file, or a procedure or user-defined function
     definition.

     During the compilation of CA-Clipper source code, all explicit
     references to procedures and user-defined functions are made to the
     linker.  In some instances, within a source file, there may be no
     references made to procedure or user-defined function names until
     runtime.  REQUEST resolves this situation by forcing the named
     procedures or user-defined functions to be linked even if they are not
     explicitly referenced in the source file.  This is important in several
     instances:

     <B>.</B>  Procedures, user-defined functions, or formats referenced with
        macro expressions or variables

     <B>.</B>  Procedures and user-defined functions used in REPORT and LABEL
        FORMs and not referenced in the source code

     <B>.</B>  User-defined functions used in index keys and not referenced
        in the source code

     <B>.</B>  ACHOICE(), DBEDIT(), or MEMOEDIT() user functions

     <B>.</B>  Initialization procedures declared with the INIT PROCEDURE
        statement

     <B>.</B>  Exit procedures declared with the EXIT PROCEDURE statement

     To group common REQUESTs together, place them in a header file and then
     #include the header file into each program file (.prg) that might
     indirectly use them.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example shows a typical header file consisting of common
        REQUESTs for REPORT FORMs:

        // Request.ch

        REQUEST HARDCR
        REQUEST TONE
        REQUEST MEMOTRAN
        REQUEST STRTRAN
