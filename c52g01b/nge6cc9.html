     CA-Clipper 5.2 provides many new and enhanced commands and functions
     that can be used to access and manipulate databases and get specific
     information about the RDD in use.  These language elements were
     summarized in the previous chapter, and this chapter provides a detailed
     alphabetical reference to them.

     This chapter contains entries for all new CA-Clipper commands and
     functions designed for use with RDDs.  As for existing language
     elements, only those that were changed to accommodate the new RDD
     architecture are documented here.

     Other language elements that are specifically designed for database
     manipulation and have not been altered (e.g., USE) are documented in the
     Reference guide.  Using Appendix G: Categorized Language Tables in the
     Error Messages and Appendices guide, you can find these language
     elements categorized under database or index.

     The refinement of the CA-Clipper language, both additions and
     enhancements, ensures consistent language support for access to
     different data formats and allows you to design applications that are
     not dependent on a particular data format.  In other words, you can use
     the same commands and functions to manipulate a FoxPro database as you
     would use to manipulate a dBASE IV database.

     The entries in this chapter are organized like the entries in the
     Reference guide.  The <B>Status</B> section, however, is new to this
     chapter.  This section declares the command or function as New or
     Enhanced.  These categories are defined as follows:

     <B>.  New: </B> The entry is completely new, as of version 5.2, to the
        CA-Clipper language.

     <B>.  Enhanced: </B> The entry is an established part of the CA-Clipper
        language (i.e., it existed prior to version 5.2) but has been
        modified to accommodate the new RDD architecture.

        All syntax changes for enhanced commands and functions are marked in
        <B>bold</B>.
