 <B>SET CURSOR</B>
 Toggle the screen cursor on or off
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET CURSOR ON | off | &lt;xlToggle&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>ON</B> enables the cursor display.

     <B>OFF</B> disables the cursor display.

     <B>&lt;xlToggle&gt;</B> is a logical expression that must be enclosed in
     parentheses.  A value of true (.T.) is the same as ON, and a value of
     false (.F.) is the same as OFF.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET CURSOR toggles the screen cursor on or off.  When the CURSOR is OFF,
     keyboard entry and screen display are unaffected.  The cursor is merely
     hidden and data entry may still be accomplished without the cursor being
     visible.  ROW() and COL() are updated as if the cursor was visible.

     This command suppresses the cursor while the screen is being painted.
     Ideally, the only time the cursor shows in a production program is when
     the user is editing GETs, MEMOEDIT(), or some kind of line edit.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example shows a typical use of SET CURSOR:

        LOCAL lAnswer := .F.
        @ 24, 0
        @ 24, 15 SAY "Do you want to QUIT? [Y/N]";
           GET lAnswer;
           PICTURE "Y"
        SET CURSOR ON
        READ
        SET CURSOR OFF
