 <B>Modularity</B>

     (modular programming) Roughly, a measure of a system's adherence to the
     principles of modular programming.  The principles of modular
     programming are not precisely defined, but may be said to comprise these
     basic ideas:  programs should be organized as well-defined modules;
     modules should correspond with syntactic units of the programming
     language (such as functions or source files); a module should accomplish
     a well-defined task;  a module should interact with as few other modules
     as possible;  interactions between modules should be explicitly
     specified in the source code for the modules;  modules should obey the
     principle of information hiding.
