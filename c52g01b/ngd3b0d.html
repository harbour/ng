 Simple assign--binary                           (Assignment)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>&lt;idVar&gt; = &lt;exp&gt;</B>

 <B>Type</B>

     All

 <B>Operands</B>

     <B>&lt;idVar&gt;</B> is a valid variable identifier of any storage class,
     including a field variable.  If &lt;idVar&gt; is not visible or does not
     exist, a private variable is created and assigned the result of &lt;exp&gt;.

     <B>&lt;exp&gt;</B> is the expression whose result is assigned to &lt;idVar&gt;.

 <B>Description</B>

     The simple assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.  It is
     identical in operation to the STORE command that initializes a single
     variable and must be specified as a program statement.  The inline
     assignment operator (:=) is like the = operator except that you can
     specify it within expressions.  If you specify the simple assign
     operator (=) within an expression, it is interpreted as the equality (=)
     operator.

     <B>Note: </B> You cannot initialize a specific variable using the simple
     assign operator (=) in a declaration statement.  Only the inline assign
     (:=) operator can be used for this purpose.

     If the reference to &lt;idVar&gt; is ambiguous (i.e., not declared at compile
     time and not explicitly qualified with an alias) &lt;idVar&gt; is always
     assumed to be MEMVAR.  At runtime, if no private or public variable
     exists with the specified name, a private variable is created.  To
     assign a field variable with the = operator, you must declare the field
     variable name in a FIELD statement or refer to the field name prefaced
     by the FIELD-&gt; alias or the name of the work area.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  These examples are valid simple assignment statements:

        nValue = 25
        nNewValue = SQRT(nValue) ** 5
        nOldValue = nValue

     <B>.</B>  In this example, the two lines are equivalent:

        FIELD-&gt;CustAge = 20
        REPLACE CustAge WITH 20
