 <B>DELETE</B>
 Mark records for deletion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DELETE [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to DELETE.  If a
     scope is not specified, DELETE acts only on the current record.  If a
     conditional clause is specified, the default becomes ALL records.

     <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the
     condition from the current record until the condition fails.

     <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records to DELETE
     within the given scope.

 <B>Description</B>

     DELETE is a database command that tags records so they can be filtered
     with SET DELETED ON, queried with DELETED(), or physically removed from
     the database file with PACK.  In addition, display commands such as LIST
     and DISPLAY identify deleted records with an asterisk (*) character.
     Once records are deleted, you can reinstate them by using RECALL.  If
     you want to remove all records from a database file, use ZAP instead of
     DELETE ALL and PACK.

     In a network environment, DELETE requires the current record be locked
     with RLOCK() if you are DELETEing a single record.  If you are DELETEing
     several records, the current database file must be locked with FLOCK()
     or USEed EXCLUSIVEly.  Refer to the Network Programming chapter in the
     Programming and Utilities guide for more information.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  DELETE with SET DELETED ON:</B> If the current record is deleted
        with SET DELETED ON, it will be visible until the record pointer is
        moved.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates use of the FOR clause to mark a set
        of records for deletion:

        USE Sales INDEX Salesman NEW
        DELETE ALL FOR Inactive
