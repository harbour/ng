     <B>ColorSpec                                    (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a character string defining the display attributes for the
        Get object.  The string must contain two color specifiers. The first,
        called the unselected color, determines the color of the Get object
        when it does not have input focus.  The second, called the selected
        color, determines the color of the Get when it has input focus.

        If no colors are specified, Get:ColorSpec is initialized using the
        current SETCOLOR() colors.  The SETCOLOR() unselected and enhanced
        colors are used as the Get object's unselected and selected colors,
        respectively.  See the SETCOLOR() entry in this chapter for more
        information on color specifiers.

        oGet:ColorSpec := "N/BG, W+/BG"
