 <B>SET PATH</B>
 Specify the CA-Clipper search path for opening files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET PATH TO [&lt;xcPathspec list&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>TO &lt;xcPathspec list&gt;</B> identifies the paths CA-Clipper uses when
     searching for a file not found in the current directory.  You can
     specify it as a literal list or as a character expression enclosed in
     parentheses.  The list of paths can be separated by commas or
     semicolons.  However, continuation of a SET PATH command line with a
     semicolon is not supported unless &lt;xcPathspec&gt; is specified as a
     character expression enclosed in parentheses.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET PATH allows commands and functions that open database and associated
     files to find and open existing files in another drive and/or directory.
     It does this by specifying a path list to search if a referenced file
     cannot be found in the DEFAULT or specified directory.  Note that memo
     and low-level file functions respect neither the DEFAULT nor the PATH
     SETting.

     A path is a pointer to a directory.  It consists of an optional drive
     letter and colon, followed by a list of directories from the root to the
     desired directory separated by backslash (\) characters.  A path list is
     the sequence of paths to search, each separated by a comma or semicolon.

     When you attempt to access a file, CA-Clipper first searches the default
     drive and directory.  The default disk drive and directory are
     established by DOS when your CA-Clipper application is loaded, or,
     during execution, by SET DEFAULT.  If the file is not found, CA-Clipper
     then searches each path in the specified path list until the first
     occurrence of the file is found.

     To create new files in another drive or directory, use SET DEFAULT TO
     &lt;xcPathspec&gt; or explicitly declare the path when specifying a new
     filename.

     SET PATH TO with no argument releases the path list and CA-Clipper
     searches only the DEFAULT directory.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example is a typical PATH command:

        SET PATH TO A:\INVENTORY;B:\VENDORS

     <B>.</B>  This example configures a path setting at runtime by passing a
        DOS environment variable to a program, retrieving its value with
        GETENV(), then SETting PATH with this value.  For example, in DOS:

        SET CLIP_PATH=C:\APPS\DATA,C:\APPS\PROGS

        Later in the configuration section of your application program:

        SET PATH TO (GETENV("CLIP_PATH"))
