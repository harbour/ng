     <B>Result Pattern</B>

     The &lt;resultPattern&gt; portion of a translation directive is the text the
     preprocessor will produce if a piece of input text matches the
     &lt;matchPattern&gt;.  &lt;resultPattern&gt; is made from one or more of the
     following components:

     <B>.  Literal tokens</B> are actual characters that are written directly
        to the result text.

     <B>.  Words</B> are CA-Clipper keywords and identifiers that are written
        directly to the result text.

     <B>.  Result markers</B> refer directly to a match marker name.  Input
        text matched by the match marker is written to the result text via
        the result marker.

        This table lists the Result marker forms.

        <B>Result Markers</B>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        <B>Result Marker     Name</B>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        &lt;idMarker&gt;        Regular result marker
        #&lt;idMarker&gt;       Dumb stringify result marker
        &lt;"idMarker"&gt;      Normal stringify result marker
        &lt;(idMarker)&gt;      Smart stringify result marker
        &lt;{idMarker}&gt;      Blockify result marker
        &lt;.idMarker.&gt;      Logify result marker
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        <B>-  Regular result marker:</B> Writes the matched input text to the
           result text, or nothing if no input text is matched.  Use this,
           the most general result marker, unless you have special
           requirements.  You can use it with any of the match markers, but
           it almost always is used with the regular match marker.

        <B>-  Dumb stringify result marker:</B> Stringifies the matched input
           text and writes it to the result text.  If no input text is
           matched, it writes a null ("") string.  If the matched input text
           is a list matched by a list match marker, this result marker
           stringifies the entire list and writes it to the result text.

           This result marker writes output to result text where a string is
           always required.  This is generally the case for commands where a
           command or clause argument is specified as a literal value but the
           result text must always be written as a string even if the
           argument is not specified.

        <B>-  Normal stringify result marker:</B> Stringifies the matched input
           text and writes it to the result text.  If no input text is
           matched, it writes nothing to the result text.  If the matched
           input text is a list matched by a list match marker, this result
           marker stringifies each element in the list and writes it to the
           result text.

           The normal stringify result marker is most often used with the
           blockify result marker to compile an expression while saving a
           text image of the expression (See the SET FILTER condition and the
           INDEX key expression in STD.CH).

        <B>-  Smart stringify result marker:</B> Stringifies matched input text
           only if source text is enclosed in parentheses.  If no input text
           matched, it writes nothing to the result text.  If the matched
           input text is a list matched by a list match marker, this result
           marker stringifies each element in the list (using the same
           stringify rule) and writes it to the result text.

           The smart stringify result marker is designed specifically to
           support extended expressions for commands other than SETs with
           &lt;xlToggle&gt; arguments.  Extended expressions are command syntax
           elements that can be specified as literal text or as an expression
           if enclosed in parentheses.  The &lt;xcDatabase&gt; argument of the USE
           command is a typical example.  For instance, if the matched input
           for the &lt;xcDatabase&gt; argument is the word Customer, it is written
           to the result text as the string "Customer," but the expression
           (cPath + cDatafile) would be written to the result text unchanged
           (i.e., without quotes).

        <B>-  Blockify result marker:</B> Writes matched input text as a code
           block without any arguments to the result text.  For example, the
           input text x + 3 would be written to the result text as {|| x +
           3}.  If no input text is matched, it writes nothing to the result
           text.  If the matched input text is a list matched by a list match
           marker, this result marker blockifies each element in the list.

           The blockify result marker used with the regular and list match
           markers matches various kinds of expressions and writes them as
           code blocks to the result text.  Remember that a code block is a
           piece of compiled code to execute sometime later.  This is
           important when defining commands that evaluate expressions more
           than once per invocation.  When defining a command, you can use
           code blocks to pass an expression to a function and procedure as
           data rather than as the result of an evaluation.  This allows the
           target routine to evaluate the expression whenever necessary.

           In STD.CH, the blockify result marker defines database commands
           where an expression is evaluated for each record.  Commonly, these
           are field or expression lists, FOR and WHILE conditions, or key
           expressions for commands that perform actions based on key values.

        <B>-  Logify result marker:</B> Writes true (.T.) to the result text if
           any input text is matched; otherwise, it writes false (.F.) to the
           result text.  This result marker does not write the input text
           itself to the result text.

           The logify result marker is generally used with the restricted match
           marker to write true (.T.) to the result text if an optional
           clause is specified with no argument; otherwise it writes false
           (.F.).  In STD.CH, this formulation defines the EXCLUSIVE and
           SHARED clauses of the USE command.

     <B>.  Repeating result clauses</B> are portions of the &lt;resultPattern&gt;
        enclosed by square brackets ([ ]).  The text within a repeating
        clause is written to the result text as many times as it has input
        text for any or all result markers within the clause.  If there is no
        matching input text, the repeating clause is not written to the
        result text.  Repeating clauses, however, cannot be nested.  If you
        need to nest repeating clauses, you probably need an additional
        #command rule for the current command.

        Repeating clauses are the result pattern part of the #command
        facility that create optional clauses which have arguments.  You can
        match input text with any match marker other than the restricted
        match marker and write to the result text with any of the
        corresponding result markers.  Typical examples of this facility are
        the definitions for the STORE and REPLACE commands in STD.CH.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Less than operator:</B> If you specify the less than operator (&lt;)
        in the &lt;resultPattern&gt; expression, you must precede it with the
        escape character (\).

     <B>.  Multistatement lines:</B> You can specify more than one statement
        as a part of the result pattern by separating each statement with a
        semicolon.  If you specify adjacent statements on two separate lines,
        the first statement must be followed by two semicolons.

 <B>Examples</B>

     These examples encompass many of the basic techniques you can use when
     defining commands with the #command and #translate directives.  In
     general, these examples are based on standard commands defined in
     STD.CH.  Note, however, the functions specified in the example result
     patterns are not the actual functions found in STD.CH, but fictitious
     functions specified for illustration only.

     <B>.</B>  This example defines the @...BOX command using regular match
        markers with regular result markers:

        #command  @ &lt;top&gt;, &lt;left&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;, &lt;right&gt; BOX ;
              &lt;boxstring&gt;;
        =&gt;;
              CmdBox( &lt;top&gt;, &lt;left&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;, ;
              &lt;right&gt;,&lt;boxstring&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  This example uses a list match marker with a regular result
        marker to define the ? command:

        #command ? [&lt;list,...&gt;] =&gt; QOUT(&lt;list&gt;)

     <B>.</B>  This example uses a restricted match marker with a logify
        result marker to implement an optional clause for a command
        definition.  In this example, if the ADDITIVE clause is specified,
        the logify result marker writes true (.T.) to the result text;
        otherwise, it writes false (.F.):

        #command RESTORE FROM &lt;file&gt; [&lt;add: ADDITIVE&gt;];
        =&gt;;
              CmdRestore( &lt;(file)&gt;, &lt;.add.&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  This example uses a list match marker with a smart stringify
        result marker to write to the result text the list of fields
        specified as the argument of a FIELDS clause.  In this example, the
        field list is written as an array with each field name as an element
        of the array:

        #command COPY TO &lt;file&gt; [FIELDS &lt;fields,...&gt;];
        =&gt;;
              CmdCopyAll( &lt;(file)&gt;, { &lt;(fields)&gt; } )

     <B>.</B>  These examples use the wild match marker to define a command
        that writes nothing to the result text.  Do this when attempting to
        compile unmodified code developed in another dialect:

        #command SET ECHO &lt;*text*&gt;    =&gt;
        #command SET TALK &lt;*text*&gt;    =&gt;

     <B>.</B>  These examples use wild match markers with dumb stringify
        result markers to match command arguments specified as literals, then
        write them to the result text as strings in all cases:

        #command SET PATH TO &lt;*path*&gt;  =&gt;  ;
           SET( _SET_PATH, #&lt;path&gt; )
        #command SET COLOR TO &lt;*spec*&gt; =&gt;  SETCOLOR( #&lt;spec&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  These examples use a normal result marker with the blockify
        result marker to both compile an expression and save the text version
        of it for later use:

        #command SET FILTER TO &lt;xpr&gt;;
        =&gt;;
              CmdSetFilter( &lt;{xpr}&gt;, &lt;"xpr"&gt; )

        #command INDEX ON &lt;key&gt; TO &lt;file&gt;;
        =&gt;;
              CmdCreateIndex( &lt;(File)&gt;, &lt;"Key"&gt;, &lt;{Key}&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates how the smart stringify result
        marker implements a portion of the USE command for those arguments
        that can be specified as extended expressions:

        #command USE &lt;db&gt; [ALIAS &lt;a&gt;];
        =&gt;;
              CmdOpenDbf( &lt;(db)&gt;, &lt;(a)&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  This example illustrates the importance of the blockify result
        marker for defining a database command.  Here, the FOR and WHILE
        conditions matched in the input text are written to the result text
        as code blocks:

        #command COUNT [TO &lt;var&gt;];
              [FOR &lt;for&gt;] [WHILE &lt;while&gt;];
              [NEXT &lt;next&gt;] [RECORD &lt;rec&gt;] [&lt;rest:REST&gt;] [ALL];
        =&gt;;
              &lt;var&gt; := 0,;
              DBEVAL( {|| &lt;var&gt;++}, &lt;{for}&gt;, &lt;{while}&gt;,;
                 &lt;next&gt;, &lt;rec&gt;, &lt;.rest.&gt; )

     <B>.</B>  In this example the USE command again demonstrates the types
        of optional clauses with keywords in the match pattern; one clause is
        a keyword followed by a command argument, and the second is solely a
        keyword:

        #command USE &lt;db&gt; [&lt;new: NEW&gt;] [ALIAS &lt;a&gt;] ;
              [INDEX &lt;index,...&gt;][&lt;ex: EXCLUSIVE&gt;] ;
              [&lt;sh: SHARED&gt;] [&lt;ro: READONLY&gt;];
        =&gt;;
              CmdOpenDbf(&lt;(db)&gt;, &lt;(a)&gt;, &lt;.new.&gt;,;
                 IF(&lt;.sh.&gt; .OR. &lt;.ex.&gt;, !&lt;.ex.&gt;, NIL),;
                    &lt;.ro.&gt;, {&lt;(index)&gt;})

     <B>.</B>  This example uses the STORE command definition to illustrate
        the relationship between an optional match clause and a repeating
        result clause:

        #command STORE &lt;value&gt; TO &lt;var1&gt; [, &lt;varN&gt; ];
        =&gt;;
              &lt;var1&gt; := [ &lt;varN&gt; := ] &lt;value&gt;

     <B>.</B>  This example uses #translate to define a pseudofunction:

        #translate AllTrim(&lt;cString&gt;) =&gt; LTRIM(RTRIM(&lt;cString&gt;))
