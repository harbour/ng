 <B>DELETE FILE</B>
 Remove a file from disk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DELETE FILE | ERASE &lt;xcFile&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;xcFile&gt;</B> is the name of the file to be deleted from disk and can be
     specified either as a literal filename or as a character expression
     enclosed in parentheses.  You must specify the filename, including the
     extension, and it may optionally be preceded by a drive and/or path
     specification.

 <B>Description</B>

     DELETE FILE, a synonym for ERASE, is a file command that removes the
     specified file from disk.  SET DEFAULT and SET PATH do not affect DELETE
     FILE.  The file is deleted from disk only if found in the current DOS
     directory or in the directory explicitly specified as part of the
     filename.

     <B>Warning! </B> Files must be CLOSEd before deleting them.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example removes a specified file from disk then tests to
        see if the file was in fact removed:

        ? FILE("Temp.dbf")               // Result: .T.
        DELETE FILE Temp.dbf
        ? FILE("Temp.dbf")               // Result: .F.
