 <B>INIT PROCEDURE</B>
 Declare an initialization procedure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>INIT PROCEDURE &lt;idProcedure&gt; [(&lt;idParam list&gt;)]</B>
     <B>   [FIELD &lt;idField list&gt; [IN &lt;idAlias&gt;]]</B>
     <B>   [LOCAL &lt;identifier&gt; [[:= &lt;initializer&gt;]]]</B>
     <B>   [MEMVAR &lt;identifer list&gt;]</B>
     <B>   .</B>
     <B>   . &lt;executable statements&gt;</B>
     <B>   .</B>
     <B>   [RETURN]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>INIT PROCEDURE</B> declares a procedure that will be executed at program
     startup.

     <B>&lt;idProcedure&gt;</B> is the name of the initialization procedure to
     declare. Initialization procedure names can be any length, but only the
     first 10 characters are significant.  Names may not begin with an
     underscore but can contain any combination of characters, numbers, or
     underscores.

     <B>&lt;idParam list&gt;</B> is the declaration of one or more parameter
     variables. Variables specified in this list are declared local.

     <B>FIELD</B> declares a list of identifiers to use as field names whenever
     encountered.  If the IN clause is specified, referring to the declared
     name includes an implicit reference to the specified alias.

     <B>LOCAL</B> declares, and optionally initializes, a list of variables or
     arrays whose visibility and lifetime is the current procedure.

     <B>MEMVAR</B> declares a list of identifiers to use as private or public
     memory variables or arrays whenever encountered.

     <B>RETURN</B> passes control to the next initialization procedure or the
     first executable routine in the program, if no other initialization
     procedures are pending.

 <B>Description</B>

     The INIT PROCEDURE statement declares a procedure that will be executed
     at program startup.  INIT procedures are called prior to the first
     executable statement in a CA-Clipper  application, and are useful for
     performing common initialization tasks such as reading configuration
     settings, or opening a communications port.

     INIT PROCEDUREs are executed implicitly by CA-Clipper  at program
     startup.  The visibility of initialization procedures is restricted to
     the system; therefore, it is not possible to call an INIT PROCEDURE from
     a procedure or user-defined function.  Each INIT PROCEDURE receives a
     copy of the DOS command line arguments used to invoke the application.

     Control passes from one INIT PROCEDURE to the next until all procedures
     in the initialization list have been called.  Control then passes to the
     first executable statement in the program.

     The ANNOUNCE statement declares a module identifier for a source (.prg)
     file.  Once declared, INIT PROCEDUREs are referenced by this module
     identifier.  An application may use any number of initialization
     procedures by explicitly REQUESTing their module identifiers.

     The INIT PROCEDUREs requested for an appplication are collectively
     referred to as the initialization list.  There is no default execution
     order of procedures in the initialization list; however, the following
     rules apply:

     <B>.</B>  The CA-Clipper initialization procedure, CLIPINIT, is always
        called first.

     <B>.</B>  If an INIT PROCEDURE is declared in the same source (.prg)
        file as the application's primary (root) routine, it will be the last
        initialization procedure called.

     CLIPINIT is called first to establish system integrity by installing the
     default error recovery system (ErrorSys).  Once CLIPINIT has finished
     executing, control passes to the next INIT PROCEDURE in the
     initialization list.

     If an error is raised during system initialization, the system returns
     to DOS, and pending initialization procedures are not called.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example uses both INIT and EXIT PROCEDUREs to save and
        restore the context of the operating system.  By simply REQUESTing
        "SaveDos" in your main source file, the context of the operating
        system is preserved:

        ANNOUNCE SaveDos

        #define DOS_SCREEN   1
        #define DOS_ROW      2
        #define DOS_COL      3
        #define DOS_CURSOR   4
        #define DOS_COUNT    4

        STATIC saSaveDos[ SD_COUNT ]

        INIT PROCEDURE dosSave()
           SAVE SCREEN TO saSaveDos[ DOS_SCREEN ]
           saSaveDos[ DOS_ROW ]    := ROW()
           saSaveDos[ DOS_COL ]    := COL()
           saSaveDos[ DOS_CURSOR ] := SETCURSOR()
           RETURN

        EXIT PROCEDURE dosRestore()
           RESTORE SCREEN FROM saSaveDos[ DOS_SCREEN ]
           SETPOS   ( saSaveDos[ DOS_ROW ], saSaveDos[ DOS_COL ] )
           SETCURSOR( saSaveDos[ DOS_CURSOR ] )
           RETURN
