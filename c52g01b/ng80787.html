 <B>CONTINUE</B>
 Resume a pending LOCATE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CONTINUE</B>

 <B>Description</B>

     CONTINUE is a database command that searches from the current record
     position for the next record meeting the most recent LOCATE condition
     executed in the current work area.  It terminates when a match is found
     or end of file is encountered.  If CONTINUE is successful, the matching
     record becomes the current record and FOUND() returns true (.T.); if
     unsuccessful, FOUND() returns false (.F.).

     Each work area may have an active LOCATE condition.  In CA-Clipper, a
     LOCATE condition remains pending until a new LOCATE condition is
     specified.  No other commands release the condition.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Scope and WHILE condition:</B> Note that the scope and WHILE
        condition of the initial LOCATE are ignored; only the FOR condition
        is used with CONTINUE.  If you are using a LOCATE with a WHILE
        condition and want to continue the search for a matching record, use
        SKIP and then repeat the original LOCATE statement adding REST as the
        scope.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example scans records in Sales.dbf for a particular
        salesman and displays a running total sales amounts:

        LOCAL nRunTotal := 0
        USE Sales NEW
        LOCATE FOR Sales-&gt;Salesman = "1002"
        DO WHILE FOUND()
           ? Sales-&gt;Salesname, nRunTotal += Sales-&gt;Amount
           CONTINUE
        ENDDO

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates how to continue if the pending
        LOCATE scope contains a WHILE condition:

        LOCAL nRunTotal := 0
        USE Sales INDEX Salesman NEW
        SEEK "1002"
        LOCATE REST WHILE Sales-&gt;Salesman = "1002";
              FOR Sales-&gt;Amount &gt; 5000
        DO WHILE FOUND()
           ? Sales-&gt;Salesname, nRunTotal += Sales-&gt;Amount
           SKIP
           LOCATE REST WHILE Sales-&gt;Salesman = "1002";
              FOR Sales-&gt;Amount &gt; 5000
        ENDDO
