 <B>DBGOTOP()</B>
 Move to the first logical record
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBGOTOP() --&gt; NIL</B>

 <B>Returns</B>

     DBGOTOP() always returns NIL.

 <B>Description</B>

     DBGOTOP() moves to the first logical record in the current work area.

     DBGOTOP() performs the same function as the standard GO TOP command.
     For more information, refer to the GO TOP command.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Logical records:</B> DBGOTOP() operates on logical records.  If
        there is an active index, DBGOTOP() moves to the first record in
        indexed order.  If a filter is set, only records which meet the
        filter condition are considered.

     <B>.  Controlling order:</B> If more than one index is active in the
        work area, the operation is performed using the controlling order as
        set by DBSETORDER() or the SET ORDER command.  For more information,
        refer to the SET ORDER command.

     <B>.  Network environment:</B> For a shared file on a network, moving to
        a different record may cause updates to the current record to become
        visible to other processes.  For more information, refer to the
        Network Programming chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates the typical use of DBGOTOP():

        DBGOTOP()
        WHILE ( !EOF() )
           ? FIELD-&gt;Name
           DBSKIP()
        END
