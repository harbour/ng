 <B>Hard Carriage Return</B>

     (general) An explicit carriage return character at the end of a line in
     a text file, as opposed to a soft carriage return that might be inserted
     into text by a program designed to handle word wrapping.  A hard
     carriage return character is generated by the expression (CHR(13)) where
     a soft carriage return character is generated with the expression
     (CHR(141)).
