     <B>OsCode                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an integer numeric value representing the operating system
        error code associated with the error condition.  A value of zero
        indicates that the error condition was not caused by an error from
        the operating system.  When Error:OsCode is set to a value other than
        zero DOSERROR() is updated with the same value.

        Error:OsCode properly reflects the DOS extended error code for file
        errors.  This allows proper distinction between errors which result
        from sharing violations (e.g., opening EXCLUSIVE when another process
        has already opened the file) and access violations (e.g., opening
        read/write when the file is marked read-only).

        For a list of DOS error codes refer to the Error Messages and
        Appendices guide.

        If oNewErr:OsCode == DOS_SHARING_ERROR
           .
           .
           .

        Endif
