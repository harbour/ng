 <B>Symbol</B>

     (linker) An assigned name for a value representing a constant or the
     address of code or data.  There are four types of symbols used by the
     linker defined as follows:

     <B>.</B>  Absolute symbol: a constant

     <B>.</B>  Relative symbol: address of code or data

     <B>.</B>  Public symbol: accessed by modules other than the module in
        which they are defined.  Public symbols are used to share procedures
        and variables between modules.  As such, the relative address of a
        public symbol is assigned by the compiler during compilation.

     <B>.</B>  External symbol: a public symbol not defined in the current
        module.  Generally, these are references into CLIPPER.LIB or
        EXTEND.LIB, but the compiler generates them whenever there is a
        procedure or user-defined function referenced but not compiled into
        the current module.
