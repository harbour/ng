 <B>Map File (.MAP)</B>

     (linker) The map file (.MAP) contains information about symbol and
     segment addresses within the memory image created by .RTLink.  It is
     generated when requested through the use of the appropriate command line
     switch.  A map file generated during a link will have much more
     information than one produced during the creation of a prelinked
     library.  During the .PLL creation, only symbols, names, and some
     relative addresses are known.  During a link, the final memory layout is
     known, and a more detailed map can be created.
