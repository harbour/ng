 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>INDEX ON &lt;expKey&gt; TO &lt;xcIndex&gt; [UNIQUE]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;scope&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [[EVAL &lt;lCondition&gt;][EVERY &lt;nRecords&gt;]]</B>
     <B>   [ASCENDING | DESCENDING]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;expKey&gt;</B> is an expression that returns the key value to place in the
     index for each record in the current work area.  &lt;expKey&gt; can be
     character, date, logical, or numeric type.  The maximum length of the
     index key expression is 250 characters.

     <B>TO &lt;xcIndex&gt;</B> specifies the name of the index file to create.  You
     can specify the filename either as a literal filename or as a character
     expression enclosed in parentheses.  If the specified name does not
     include a file extension, a default extension is used.  For standard
     CA-Clipper indexes the default extension is (.ntx).  For dBASE III PLUS
     compatible indexes, the default extension is (.ndx).

     <B>UNIQUE</B> specifies that &lt;xcIndex&gt; includes only unique key values.

     <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database to INDEX.  The
     default is ALL records.  All other valid scope clauses (i.e., NEXT
     &lt;nRecords&gt;, REST, and RECORD &lt;nRecord&gt;) are permitted.  If you specify a
     scope, the database is processed in the controlling index order.  The
     scope is transient (i.e., is not stored in the (.ntx) file and not used
     for REINDEXing purposes).

     <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records on which
     to index.  Only those records that meet the condition are included in
     the resulting index (.ntx) file.  The maximum length of the FOR
     expression is 250 characters.  The FOR condition is stored as part of
     the (.ntx) file and therefore used when updating or recreating the index
     using the REINDEX command.

     <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies another condition that each record
     processed must meet; as soon as a record is encountered that causes the
     condition to fail, the INDEX command terminates.  If a WHILE clause is
     specified, the database file is processed in the controlling index
     order.  The WHILE condition is transient (i.e., is not stored in the
     (.ntx) file and not used for index updates and REINDEXing purposes).

     <B>EVAL &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies a condition that is evaluated either for
     each record processed or at the interval specified by the EVERY clause.
     This clause provides a flexible way to monitor the progress of the
     indexing operation.  &lt;lCondition&gt; may be any logical expression,
     including a user-defined function that displays status information and
     then returns a logical value.  The value of &lt;lCondition&gt; is transient
     which means that it is discarded after the index is created (i.e., it is
     not retained for REINDEXing purposes).  Indexing stops if the EVAL
     condition returns false (.F.)

     <B>EVERY &lt;nRecords&gt;</B> specifies a numeric expression that modifies how
     often EVAL is evaluated.  When using EVAL, the EVERY option offers a
     performance enhancement by evaluating the condition for every nth record
     instead of for each record indexed.  The EVERY keyword is ignored if no
     EVAL condition is specified.

     <B>Note: </B> Since &lt;scope&gt;, WHILE, EVAL, and EVERY are transient, they
     will not be available when the database is REINDEXed.  Although the
     REINDEX command does provide for EVAL and EVERY clauses, &lt;scope&gt; and
     WHILE are not allowed as part of the REINDEX operation.  Thus, scoping
     is useful only for immediate queries.

     <B>ASCENDING</B> specifies that the index keys be sorted in increasing
     order of value.  If neither ASCENDING nor DESCENDING is specified,
     ASCENDING is assumed.  Although not stored as an explicit part of the
     (.ntx) file, ASCENDING is an implicit (.ntx) file attribute that is
     understood by the REINDEX command.

     <B>DESCENDING</B> specifies that the index keys be sorted in decreasing
     order of value.  Using this keyword is the same as specifying the
     DESCEND() function within &lt;expKey&gt;, but without the performance penalty
     during index updates.  If you create a DESCENDING index, you won't need
     to use the DESCEND() function during a SEEK.  DESCENDING is an attribute
     of the (.ntx) file, where it is stored and used for REINDEXing purposes.

 <B>Description</B>

     INDEX is a database command that creates a file containing an index of
     records in the current database file, based on &lt;expKey&gt;.  When the index
     file is used, the database file records appear in key expression order
     although the index does not alter the physical order of records within
     the database file.  INDEX orders character keys in accordance with the
     ASCII value of each character within the string, numeric values in
     numeric order, date values chronological order with blank dates treated
     as low values, and logical values sorted with true (.T.) treated as high
     values.  Memo fields cannot be INDEXed.

     When INDEX ON is invoked, all open index files in the current work area
     are closed and the new index file is created.  When the indexing
     operation finishes, the new index remains open becoming the controlling
     index and the record pointer is positioned to the first record in the
     index.

     INDEX is like SORT but does not make a physical copy of the database
     file and is updated each time a new key value is entered in the current
     database file.  SORT is primarily used to copy an ordered subset of
     records to another database file.

     In a network environment, INDEX opens &lt;xcIndex&gt; exclusive.  Failure to
     open the file raises , a runtime error.  Refer to the Network
     Programming chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide for more
     information.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Date indexes:</B> CA-Clipper supports date indexes for both (.ntx)
        and (.ndx) index types.  For a key expression that includes a date as
        a subset of the key, create the expression as character data type and
        use DTOS() to convert the date to character.

     <B>.  Declared variables:</B> You cannot use local and static variables
        in index key expressions.  This is because index expressions are
        saved as text in the index files and are later compiled and run using
        the macro operator (&amp;) to produce the actual key values.  Since
        locals and statics are invisible within macro variables and
        expressions, references to them within index key expressions are not
        resolved properly.

        For similar reasons, a variable declared with any of the other
        compile-time declarations such as MEMVAR or FIELD, are not valid
        within an index key expression.  If you need aliasing or variable
        qualification in an index key expression, implement it explicitly in
        the expression rather than through compiler declarations.  Refer to
        the discussion on variables in the Basic Concepts chapter of the
        Programming and Utilities guide.

     <B>.  Deleted and filtered records:</B> Records that are filtered or
        marked for deletion are included in the index.

     <B>.  Dictionary order indexes:</B> To create a dictionary order index
        of character keys, use UPPER(&lt;expKey&gt;) as the index expression.
        Dictionary order is an order where capitalization is ignored.

     <B>.  Compatible index files:</B> CA-Clipper supports dBASE III PLUS
        compatible index files using a special database driver.  Refer to the
        CA-Clipper Linker chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide for
        instructions on linking drivers.

     <B>Warning! </B> The dBASE III PLUS database driver supports the CA-Clipper
     locking mechanism in place of the dBASE III PLUS mechanism.  This means
     you cannot have both a CA-Clipper program and dBASE III PLUS
     concurrently accessing the same index files on a network without
     compromising integrity.  With two CA-Clipper programs, however, the
     dBASE III PLUS database driver works the same as the standard CA-Clipper
     database driver.

     <B>.  Unique indexes:</B> When you INDEX...UNIQUE or SET UNIQUE ON,
        CA-Clipper creates an index with uniqueness as an attribute.  As
        indexing proceeds and two or more records have the same key value,
        CA-Clipper includes only the first record in the index.  Whenever the
        unique index is updated, REINDEXed, or PACKed, only unique records
        are added.  Note that a unique index retains the uniqueness attribute
        and is unaffected by subsequent invocations of SET UNIQUE.

     <B>.  Trimming key values:</B> In CA-Clipper, an &lt;expKey&gt; that changes the
        key length may create an inoperable index.  This happens because
        CA-Clipper stores index key values in fixed increments and index key
        sizes are calculated by evaluating &lt;expKey&gt; on a blank record.  A
        trimmed &lt;expKey&gt;, therefore, always evaluates to a null string ("")
        leading to a size mismatch between the target and the defined key
        length.  To use any of the TRIM() functions within a key expression,
        use PADR() to guarantee a fixed length like this:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON PADR(RTRIM(Last) + First, 40) TO CustName

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a simple index:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON Name TO Customer

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a unique index:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON Name TO Customer UNIQUE

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a simple descending index:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON Name TO Customer DESCENDING

     <B>.</B>  This example creates an index with a progress indicator which
        displays the percentage of the database indexed every 10 records:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON Name TO Customer EVAL NtxProgress();
                 EVERY LASTREC()/10

        FUNCTION NtxProgress
        LOCAL cComplete := LTRIM(STR((RECNO()/LASTREC()) * 100))
        @ 23, 00 SAY "Indexing..." + cComplete + "%"
        RETURN .T.

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a simple conditional index using a FOR
        condition:

        USE Customer NEW
        INDEX ON Name TO Customer FOR PostalCode = "95605"

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a subindex using an existing order:

        USE Customer INDEX Customer NEW
        SEEK "SMITH"
        IF FOUND()
           INDEX ON PostalCode TO PostCode WHILE Name = "SMITH"
        ENDIF
