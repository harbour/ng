     <B>HitTop                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a logical value indicating whether an attempt was made to
        navigate past the beginning of the available data.  TBrowse:HitTop
        contains true (.T.) if an attempt was made; otherwise it contains
        false (.F.).  During stabilization, the TBrowse object sets this
        variable if TBrowse:SkipBlock indicates that it was unable to skip
        backward as many records as requested.

        lFirstRec := oTB:HitTop
