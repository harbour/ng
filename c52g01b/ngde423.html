 <B>#define</B>
 Define a manifest constant or pseudofunction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>#define &lt;idConstant&gt; [&lt;resultText&gt;]</B>
     <B>#define &lt;idFunction&gt;([&lt;arg list&gt;]) [&lt;exp&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;idConstant&gt;</B> is the name of an identifier to define.

     <B>&lt;resultText&gt;</B> is the optional replacement text to substitute whenever
     a valid &lt;idConstant&gt; is encountered.

     <B>&lt;idFunction&gt;</B> is a pseudofunction definition with an optional
     argument list (&lt;arg list&gt;).  If you include &lt;arg list&gt;, it is delimited
     by parentheses (()) immediately following &lt;idFunction&gt;.

     <B>&lt;exp&gt;</B> is the replacement expression to substitute when the
     pseudofunction is encountered.  Enclose this expression in parentheses
     to guarantee precedence of evaluation when the pseudofunction is
     expanded.

     <B>Note: </B> #define identifiers are case-sensitive, where #command and
     #translate identifiers are not.

 <B>Description</B>

     The #define directive defines an identifier and, optionally, associates
     a text replacement string.  If specified, replacement text operates much
     like the search and replace operation of a text editor.  As each source
     line from a program file is processed by the preprocessor, the line is
     scanned for identifiers.  If a currently defined identifier is
     encountered, the replacement text is substituted in its place.

     Identifiers specified with #define follow most of the identifier naming
     rules in CA-Clipper .  Defined identifiers can contain any combination
     of alphabetic and numeric characters, including underscores.  Defined
     identifiers, however, differ from other identifiers by being
     case-sensitive.  As a convention, defined identifiers are specified in
     uppercase to distinguish them from other identifiers used within a
     program.  Additionally, identifiers are specified with a one or two
     letter prefix to group similar identifiers together and guarantee
     uniqueness.  Refer to one of the supplied header files in the
     \CLIPPER5\INCLUDE directory for examples.

     When specified, each definition must occur on a line by itself.  Unlike
     statements, more than one directive cannot be specified on the same
     source line.  You may continue a definition on a subsequent line by
     employing a semicolon (;).  Each #define directive is specified followed
     by one or more white space characters (spaces or tabs), a unique
     identifier, and optional replacement text.  Definitions can be nested,
     allowing one identifier to define another.

     A defined identifier has lexical scope like a filewide static variable.
     It is only valid in the program (.prg) file in which it is defined
     unless defined in STD.CH or the header file specified on the compiler
     command line with the /U option.  Unlike a filewide static variable, a
     defined identifier is visible from the point where it is defined in the
     program file until it is either undefined, redefined, or the end of the
     program file is reached.

     You can redefine or undefine existing identifiers.  To redefine an
     identifier, specify a new #define directive with the identifier and the
     new replacement text as its arguments.  The current definition is then
     overwritten with the new definition, and a compiler warning is issued in
     case the redefinition is inadvertent.  To undefine an identifier,
     specify an #undef directive with the identifier as its argument.
     #define directives have three basic purposes:

     <B>.</B>  To define a control identifier for #ifdef and #ifndef

     <B>.</B>  To define a manifest constant--an identifier defined to
        represent a constant value

     <B>.</B>  To define a compiler pseudofunction

     The following discussion expands these three purposes of the #define
     directive in your program.

     <B>Preprocessor Identifiers</B>

     The most basic #define directive defines an identifier with no
     replacement text.  You can use this type of identifier when you need to
     test for the existence of an identifier with either the #ifdef or
     #ifndef directives.  This is useful to either exclude or include code
     for conditional compilation.  This type of identifier can also be
     defined using the /D compiler option from the compiler command line.
     See the examples below.

     <B>Manifest Constants</B>

     The second form of the #define directive assigns a name to a constant
     value.  This form of identifier is referred to as a manifest constant.
     For example, you can define a manifest constant for the INKEY() code
     associated with a key press:

     #define K_ESC  27
     IF LASTKEY() = K_ESC
        .
        . &lt;statements&gt;
        .
     ENDIF

     Whenever the preprocessor encounters a manifest constant while scanning
     a source line, it replaces it with the specified replacement text.

     Although you can accomplish this by defining a variable, there are
     several advantages to using a manifest constant: the compiler generates
     faster and more compact code for constants than for variables; variables
     have memory overhead where manifest constants have no runtime overhead,
     thus saving memory and increasing execution speed; using a variable to
     represent a constant value is conceptually inconsistent.  A variable by
     nature changes and a constant does not.

     Use a manifest constant instead of a constant for several reasons.
     First, it increases readability.  In the example above, the manifest
     constant indicates more clearly the key being represented than does the
     INKEY() code itself.  Second, manifest constants localize the definition
     of constant values, thereby making changes easier to make, and
     increasing reliability.  Third, and a side effect of the second reason,
     is that manifest constants isolate implementation or environment
     specifics when they are represented by constant values.

     To further isolate the effects of change, manifest constants and other
     identifiers can be grouped together into header files allowing you to
     share identifiers between program (.prg) files, applications, and groups
     of programmers.  Using this methodology, definitions can be standardized
     for use throughout a development organization.  Merge header files into
     the current program file by using the #include directive.

     For examples of header files, refer to the supplied header files in the
     \CLIPPER5\INCLUDE directory.

     <B>Compiler Pseudofunctions</B>

     In addition to defining constants as values, the #define directive can
     also define pseudofunctions that are resolved at compile time.  A
     pseudofunction definition is an identifier immediately followed by an
     argument list, delimited by parentheses, and the replacement expression.
     For example:

     #define AREA(nLength, nWidth)  (nLength * nWidth)
     #define SETVAR(x, y)           (x := y)
     #define MAX(x, y)              (IF(x &gt; y, x, y))

     Pseudofunctions differ from manifest constants by supporting arguments.
     Whenever the preprocessor scans a source line and encounters a function
     call that matches the pseudofunction definition, it substitutes the
     function call with the replacement expression.  The arguments of the
     function call are transported into the replacement expression by the
     names specified in the argument list of the identifier definition.  When
     the replacement expression is substituted for the pseudofunction, names
     in the replacement expression are replaced with argument text.  For
     example, the following invocations:

     ? AREA(10, 12)
     SETVAR(nValue, 10)
     ? MAX(10, 9)

     are replaced by :

     ? (10 * 12)
     nValue := 10
     ? (IF(10 &gt; 9, 10, 9)

     It is important when defining pseudofunctions, that you enclose the
     result expression in parentheses to enforce the proper order of
     evaluation.  This is particularly important for numeric expressions.  In
     pseudofunctions, you must specify all arguments.  If the arguments are
     not specified, the function call is not expanded as a pseudofunction and
     exits the preprocessor to the compiler as encountered.

     Pseudofunctions do not entail the overhead of a function call and are
     therefore generally faster.  They also use less memory.
     Pseudofunctions, however, are more difficult to debug within the
     debugger, have a scope different from declared functions and procedures,
     do not allow skipped arguments, and are case-sensitive.

     You can avoid some of these deficiencies by defining a pseudofunction
     using the #translate directive.  #translate pseudofunctions are not
     case-sensitive, allow optional arguments, and obey the dBASE four-letter
     rule.  See the #translate directive reference in this chapter for more
     information.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  In this example a manifest constant conditionally controls the
        compilation of debugging code:

        #define DEBUG
        .
        . &lt;statements&gt;
        .
        #ifdef DEBUG
           Assert(FILE("System.dbf"))
        #endif

     <B>.</B>  This example defines a manifest constant and substitutes it
        for an INKEY() value:

        #define K_ESC  27
        .
        . &lt;statements&gt;
        .
        IF INKEY() != K_ESC
           DoIt()
        ELSE
           StopIt()
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  This example defines pseudofunctions for the standard
        CA-Clipper functions, MAX() and ALLTRIM():

        #define MAX(arg1, arg2)   (IF(arg1 &gt; arg2, ;
           arg1, arg2))
        #define ALLTRIM(cString)  (RTRIM(LTRIM(cString)))
        .
        . &lt;statements&gt;
        .
        ? MAX(1, 2)
        ? ALLTRIM("  Hello  ")
