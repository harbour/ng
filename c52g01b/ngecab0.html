 <B>DELETE TAG command</B>
 Delete a Tag
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     DELETE TAG &lt;cOrderName&gt; [IN &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt;]
        [, &lt;cOrderName&gt; [IN xcOrderBagName] list&gt;]

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cOrderName&gt;</B> is a character string that represents the Order Name.

     <B>&lt;xcOrderBagName&gt;</B> is the name of a disk file containing one or more
     Orders.  You may specify &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt; as the filename with or
     without the pathname or appropriate extension.  If you do not include
     the extension as part of &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt; CA-Clipper uses the default
     extension of the current RDD.

     <B>&lt;cOrderName ...list&gt;</B> is an optional list of Order and Order Bag Name
     pairs, separated by commas.  Any reference to &lt;cOrderName&gt; that results
     in either a null string ("") or spaces is ignored.  You can specify each
     Order as a literal expression or as a character expression enclosed in
     parentheses.  If you specify no extension for the Order Bag Name, the
     current database driver supplies a default extension.

 <B>Description</B>

     This command removes an Order from an Order Bag in the current or
     specified work area.  If you do not specify an &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt;, all
     Orders Bags are searched in the current or specified work area.  The
     first occurrence of &lt;cOrderName&gt; is deleted.  A runtime recoverable
     error is raised if the Order is not found.

     If &lt;cOrderName&gt; is the active Order, the database in the current or
     specified work area reverts to its identity Order (natural or entry)
     order and SET FILTER scoping.

     A runtime error is raised if &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt; does not exist or if it
     exists but does not contain &lt;cOrderName&gt;.

     The active RDD determines the Order capacity of an Order Bag.  The
     default DBFNTX and the DBFNDX drivers only support single-Order Bags,
     while other RDDs may support multiple-Order Bags (e.g., the DBFCDX and
     DBFMDX drivers).

 <B>Examples</B>

     USE Customer VIA "DBFCDX" NEW
     SET INDEX TO Customer

     // Delete the Orders (Tags) Cust01 and Cust02 that
     // exist in the index file Customer
     DELETE TAG Cust01 IN Customer
     DELETE TAG Cust02 IN Customer

     // or
     // DELETE TAG Cust01 IN Customer, Cust02 IN Customer
