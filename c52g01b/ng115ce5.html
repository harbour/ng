 <B>Undefined Symbol</B>

     (linker) An unresolved symbol) that was never declared public by a
     module, but which is referenced by another module.  After the public
     symbol definition is encountered, the symbol becomes defined (resolved).
     When a symbol is referenced, but not defined, it is said to be
     undefined.
