     <B>ColorRect(&lt;aRect&gt;, &lt;aColors&gt;) --&gt; self</B>

        Directly alters the color of a rectangular group of cells.  &lt;aRect&gt;
        is an array of four numbers (top, left, bottom, and right).  The
        numbers refer to cells within the data area of the browse display,
        not to screen coordinates.  &lt;aColors&gt; is an array of two numbers.
        The numbers are used as indexes into the color table for the browse.
        These colors will become the normal and highlighted colors for the
        cells within the specified rectangle.

        Cells that are colored using colorRect retain their color until they
        are scrolled off the screen up or down.  Horizontal panning has no
        affect on these colors and, in fact, cells that are currently off
        screen left or right can be colored even if they are not visible.

        This example colors the entire virtual window (on and off screen):

        aRect := {1, 1, browse:RowCount, browse:ColCount}
        browse:ColorRect( aRect, {2, 1} )
