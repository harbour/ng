 <B>CLEAR ALL*</B>
 Close files and release public and private variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CLEAR ALL</B>

 <B>Description</B>

     CLEAR ALL releases all public and private variables, closes all open
     databases and related files in all active work areas, and SELECTs work
     area 1.  Related files are index, alternate, and memo files.  CLEAR ALL,
     however, does not release local or static variables.

     CLEAR ALL is a compatibility command and not recommended.  Its usage in
     CA-Clipper is superseded by the command or function that performs the
     specific action you need.  You can close files associated with work
     areas with one of the various forms of the CLOSE command.  You can
     release private and public variables using the RELEASE command although
     explicitly releasing variables is discouraged in most instances.  For
     more information on the scope and lifetime of variables, refer to the
     Basic Concepts chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide.
