 <B>DBSEEK()</B>
 Move to the record having the specified key value
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBSEEK(&lt;expKey&gt;, [&lt;lSoftSeek&gt;]) --&gt; lFound</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;expKey&gt;</B> is a value of any type that specifies the key value
     associated with the desired record.

     <B>&lt;lSoftSeek&gt;</B> is an optional logical value that specifies whether a
     soft seek is to be performed.  This determines how the work area is
     positioned if the specified key value is not found (see below).  If
     &lt;lSoftSeek&gt; is omitted, the current global _SET_SOFTSEEK setting is
     used.

 <B>Returns</B>

     DBSEEK() returns true (.T.) if the specified key value was found;
     otherwise, it returns false (.F.).

 <B>Description</B>

     DBSEEK() moves to the first logical record whose key value is equal to
     &lt;expKey&gt;.  If such a record is found, it becomes the current record and
     DBSEEK() returns true (.T.).  Otherwise, DBSEEK() returns false (.F.)
     and the positioning of the work area is as follows: for a normal (not
     soft) seek, the work area is positioned to LASTREC() + 1 and EOF()
     returns true (.T.); for a soft seek, the work area is positioned to the
     first record whose key value is greater than the specified key value.
     If no such record exists, the work area is positioned to LASTREC() + 1
     and EOF() returns true (.T.).

     For a work area with no active indexes, DBSEEK() has no effect.

     DBSEEK() performs the same function as the standard SEEK command.  For
     more information, refer to the SEEK command.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Logical records:</B> DBSEEK() operates on logical records.
        Records are considered in indexed order.  If a filter is set, only
        records which meet the filter condition are considered.

     <B>.  Controlling order:</B> If the work area has more than one active
        index, the operation is performed using the controlling order as set
        by DBSETORDER() or the SET ORDER command.  For more information,
        refer to the SET ORDER command.

     <B>.  Network environment:</B> For a shared file on a network, moving to
        a different record may cause updates to the current record to become
        visible to other processes.  For more information, refer to the
        Network Programming chapter in the Programming and Utilities guide.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  In this example, DBSEEK() moves the pointer to the record in
        the database, Employee, in which the value in FIELD .cName. matches
        the entered value of cName:

        ACCEPT "Employee name: " TO cName
        IF ( Employee-&gt;(DBSEEK(cName)) )
           Employee-&gt;(ViewRecord())
        ELSE
           ? "Not found"
        END
