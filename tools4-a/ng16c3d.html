 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET GROUP MEMBER
     To improve organization and simplify user access to file server
     resources, user groups can be created under Novell Netware.  Each user
     can be a member of one or more groups.  With the function NNETGRPMEM(),
     you can determine if a user is a member of a specific group.  For
     example, the branch in an application can be made dependent on the
     membership of the logged in user to a specific group.

     The file server can be specified either by its name or its connection
     ID.  The connection ID of a server is returned by NNETATTACH() or
     NNETLOGIN().

     This function requires that the requesting user be logged in on the
     related file server.

 <B>Example</B>

     Log the user into another file server if the user is a member of the
     group DEV:

     IF NNETGRPMEM(cUser,"DEV")
     NNETLOGIN(cUser,cPassword,"NANGERDEV")
     ENDIF
