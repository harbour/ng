 <B>NNETJDESC()</B>
 Reads and modifies the job description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJDESC(&lt;cQueue&gt;,&lt;nJob&gt;,[&lt;cDescription&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; cDescription</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;nJob&gt;</B>  Designates the job number of the job that is processed in
     &lt;cQueue&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cDescription&gt;</B>  Designates the new job description for &lt;nJob&gt;.  The
     job description can be up to 49 characters long.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETJDESC() returns the job description of &lt;nJob&gt; in &lt;cQueue&gt;.  If an
     error occurs (for example, if &lt;cQueue&gt; does not exist), the function
     returns an empty string.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB DESCRIPTION
     NNETJDESC() allows you to read or to modify the description of each job
     in a queue.  The description can be up to 49 characters long and is
     printed on the banner page.  By passing the parameter &lt;cDescription&gt;,
     you can overwrite the default description "LPTnCatch".  The operation
     has been successful if the returned character string is identical to the
     parameter &lt;cDescription&gt;.

     The required job is specified by its job number.  The job number has
     nothing to do with the logical position of a job within a queue.  The
     job number can be determined with NNETCAPJOB() or NNETJLIST().

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The reading of a job description requires that the requesting
        user has access to the queue as a user or an operator.  The right to
        modify a job description is reserved for the user who has created the
        job and for the queue operator.

     <B>.</B>  A job that is already in progress cannot be modified.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Query the job description for the first job in the queue
        LINEPRINTER:

        nJob=BIN2I(LEFT(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),2))
        ? NNETJDESC('LINEPRINTER',nJob)

     <B>.</B>  Start the capture mode for LPT1, send output to the queue
        LINEPRINTER, and set the description of the resulting job to
        "!CONFIDENTIAL!":

        NNETCAPSSF(1)
        NNETCAPBEG(1)
        NNETSETQ(1,'LINEPRINTER')
        SET PRINTER ON
        ? 'Hello'
        NNETJDESC('LINEPRINTER',NNETCAPJOB(1),'!CONFIDENTIAL!')
        NNETCAPFLU(1)

     <B>.</B>  The new job is always created at the first output (? "Hello"),
        not by calling NNETCAPBEG().  Therefore, NNETJDESC() must be called
        after the first output.  If NNETJDESC() is not called after the first
        output, NNETCAPJOB() returns the number of the previous capture job
        and the wrong description is modified.
