 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions in this chapter let you manipulate the drive mapping of
     workstations.  New mappings can be executed, and existing mappings can
     be deleted.  Furthermore, you can query information about current
     mappings.  The basic function of this group of functions is NNETMAP().
     NNETMAP() is used to create or delete an allocation.  All extended
     possibilities, such as search drives and fake roots, are supported.
     Drive mappings can be defined temporarily.  Temporary mappings are
     deleted automatically at the end of an application.

     In conjunction with the ability to log in a user with NNETLOGIN(), the
     functions of this chapter allow you to set up the complete network
     environment of a workstation within an application.
