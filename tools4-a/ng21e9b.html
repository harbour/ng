 <B>NNETLOGOUT()</B>
 Log out a user of one or all file servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETLOGOUT(&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;|&lt;lAll&gt;,[&lt;lConnect&gt;])</B>
     <B>    --&gt; lSuccess</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which a user is
     logged out.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;lAll&gt;</B>  Allows a log out from all file servers if designated .T..

     <B>&lt;lAttach&gt;</B>  Designates whether or not the file server remains
     attached.  If a user logs out on a file server, the workstation and the
     server are detached.  If the parameter &lt;lAttach&gt; is designated .T., the
     workstation remains attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETLOGOUT() returns .T. if the log out has been successful.  If an
     error occurs (for example if the server name or the connection ID are
     invalid), the function returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET LOGOUT
     NNETLOGOUT() allows you to log out a user on one or all file servers.

     To log out on a server, the server can be specified either by its name
     or its connection ID.  The connection ID of a server is returned by
     NNETATTACH() or NNETLOGIN().  To log out a user on all servers, the
     parameter &lt;lAll&gt; must be designated .T..

     Usually if you log out on a file server, the workstation connection is
     terminated (detached).  However ,if you want to remain attached to the
     related file server, you can pass the parameter &lt;lAttach&gt; with .T..

     To be able to perform a successful log in, at least one file server must
     be attached.  Therefore, when you use the function NNETLOGOUT(), the
     default server always remains attached and is independent of the
     parameter &lt;lAttach&gt;.

     NNETLOGOUT() can also be used to terminate a connection between a
     workstation and a file server (detach) when no user is logged in.

     <B>Important!</B>  When you call NNETLOGOUT(), all drive mappings for the
     specified server or all servers are terminated.  Files on related server
     volumes cannot be accessed, which can lead to data loss.  Before you use
     NNETLOGOUT(), make sure that all files on the network drives have been
     closed properly.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  The server name &lt;cServer&gt; must be passed in uppercase letters.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Close all databases, and then log out on all file servers:

        CLOSE DATABASES
        NNETLOGOUT(.T.)

     <B>.</B>  After you call NNETLOGOUT(), the default server is still
        attached.

     <B>.</B>  Log out on server NANGERTOOLS2:

        NNETLOGOUT('NANGERTOOLS2')
