 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET REMOVE USER FROM GROUP
     NNETREMGRP() allows you to remove one or more users from a group.  To
     remove one user, the user's login name must be passed as the single
     argument &lt;cUser&gt;.   More users can be removed by passing the array,
     &lt;aUser&gt;.  Each element of the array, &lt;aUser&gt;, contains a user name.  As
     soon as a user has been removed from a group, the user loses all the
     rights that have been granted as a member of the group.  With the
     parameters &lt;cServer&gt; or &lt;nConId&gt;, users on any attached file servers can
     be removed.  The connection ID of a server is returned by NNETATTACH()
     or NNETLOGIN().

     Supervisor rights are required on the related file server to remove a
     user from a group.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  NNETREMGRP() only removes the user from &lt;Group&gt;.  The user is
        not deleted.

     <B>.</B>  NNETCRTUSR() is a high level function based on the low level
        functions of the bindery access.  The CA-Clipper source code can be
        found on the product disks.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Remove user MIKE from the TECH group:

        IF NNETREMGRP('TECH','MIKE')&gt;0
        ? 'User removed successfully!'
        ELSE
        ? 'User cannot not be removed!'
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  Remove users JIM, STEPHEN and ED from the TOOLS group:

        NNETREMGRP('TOOLS',{'JIM','STEPHEN','ED'})
