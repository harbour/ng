 <B>NNETJSDATE()</B>
 Queries and sets a job start date
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJSDATE(&lt;cQueue&gt;,&lt;nJob&gt;,[&lt;dNew&gt;],[&lt;cServer&gt;|</B>
     <B>   &lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; dDate</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;nJob&gt;</B>  Designates the job number of the job that is processed in
     &lt;cQueue&gt;.

     <B>&lt;dNew&gt;</B>  Designates a new job start date that is set for &lt;nJob&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETJSDATE() returns the earliest date for &lt;nJob&gt; in &lt;cQueue&gt;.  The
     function returns an empty date if the job start date has not been set or
     if an error occurs (for example, if &lt;cQueue&gt; does not exist).

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB START DATE
     The Queue Management System (QMS) allows you to provide each job with a
     retention period.  A job is not serviced before that date (job start
     date).  With NNETJSDATE(), you can query or set the job start date of
     &lt;nJob&gt; in &lt;cQueue&gt;.  The required job is specified by its job number.
     The job number has nothing to do with the logical position of a job
     within a queue; for example, the job with the highest priority in a
     queue is not automatically job number 1.  The job number must be
     determined with NNETCAPJOB() or NNETJLIST().

     NNETJSDATE() returns the job start date.  An empty date indicates that
     no date has been set.  In this case, the job is serviced as soon as a
     print server is available.  ( An empty date can also indicate an error.
     A differentiation is possible with the NNETERROR() function.)

     A new job start date can be set by passing a date with the &lt;dNew&gt;
     parameter.  If &lt;dNew&gt; contains an empty date, a previously set job start
     date is removed.  If you reset a job start date, the job start time is
     removed automatically.

     To avoid an incorrect interpretation by the QMS of a time that has not
     been initialized, always set a job start time with the job start date.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  To determine a job start date, the requesting user must have
        access to the queue as a user or an operator.  The modification of a
        job start date is reserved for the user who created the job or for
        queue operators.

     <B>.</B>  A job that is already in progress cannot be modified.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Query the job start date for the first job in the queue
        LINEPRINTER:

        nJob=BIN2I(LEFT(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),2))
        ? NNETJSDATE('LINEPRINTER',nJob)

     <B>.</B>  Create the capture job, set the job start date for the
        following day, and set the job start time for 10 PM:

        NNETCAPSSF(1)
        NNETCAPBEG(1)
        NNETSETQ(1,'LINEPRINTER')
        SET PRINTER ON
        ? 'Hello'
        nJob=NNETCAPJOB(1)
        NNETJSDATE('LINEPRINTER',nJob,DATE()+1)
        NNETJSTIME('LINEPRINTER',nJob,'22:00:00')
        NNETCAPFLU(1)

     <B>.</B>  The new job is always created at the first output (? "Hello"),
        not by calling NNETCAPBEG()  Therefore, NNETJSDATE() must be called
        after the first output.  If NNETJSDATE() is not called after the
        first output, NNETCAPJOB() returns the number the previous capture
        job and the job start date is modified for the wrong job.

     <B>.</B>  Remove the retention period for the first job in the queue
        LINEPRINTER (date and time):

        nJob=BIN2I(LEFT(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),2))
        ? NNETJSDATE('LINEPRINTER',nJob,CTOD(''))
