 <B>NNETBINCL()</B>
 Closes a bindery
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETBINCL([&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; lSuccess</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt; </B> Designates the name of the file server where the bindery
     is closed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt; </B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETBINCL() returns .T. if the bindery has been closed successfully.

 <B>Description</B>

     <B>Important!</B>  NNETBINCL() is a low level bindery function and should
     be used only with extensive knowledge of the bindery concept and the
     Novell API.

     NOVELL NET BINDERY CLOSE
     Under Netware, the bindery is physically organized as two files,
     NET$BIND.SYS and NET$BVAL.SYS.  These files are hidden files in the
     SYS:SYSTEM directory.  During network operation these files are
     exclusively open and cannot be accessed directly.  For example, to
     archive the bindery files, the bindery must be closed.  The bindery can
     be closed with the NETBINCL() function, but supervisor rights are
     required.

     With the parameters &lt;cServer&gt; or &lt;nConId&gt;, the bindery can be closed on
     any attached file server.  The connection ID of a file server can be
     determined with the functions NNETATTACH() or NNETLOGIN().

     <B>Important!</B>  While the bindery is closed, much of the network is not
     functional.  The bindery should not be closed if another user is logged
     in.  The time that the bindery is closed should be kept to a minimum.

 <B>Example</B>

     In the following example, drive K: is mapped to the SYS:SYSTEM directory
     of the current file server.  If the bindery has been closed
     successfully, the bindery files are copied to a local drive with the
     FILECOPY() function.  After the FILECOPY(), the bindery is reopened with
     the NNETBINOP() function:

     IF NNETBINCL()
     FILECOPY('K:NET$BIND.SYS','C:\NET$BIND.SYS')
     FILECOPY('K:NET$BVAL.SYS','C:\NET$BVAL.SYS')
     NNETBINOP()
     ELSE
     ? 'Bindery could not be closed!'
     ENDIF
