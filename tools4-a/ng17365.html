------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETINGRPS(&lt;cUser&gt;[,&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; aGroupList</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cUser&gt; </B> Designates the name of the user whose group membership is
     determined.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt; </B> Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cUser&gt;
     is established.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt; </B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.  If no file server is specified, the function uses the
     default file server.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETINGRPS() returns a one-dimensional array.  Each array element
     contains the name of a user group.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET IN GROUPS
     To improve organization and simplify user access to file server
     resources, you can create user groups under the Novell Netware.  Each
     user can be a member of one or more groups.  With the function
     NNETINGRPS(), you can determine all the user groups to which a user
     belongs.

     The file server can be specified either by its name or its connection
     ID.  The connection ID of a server is returned by  NNETATTACH() or
     NNETLOGIN().

     To achieve results with this function, the requesting user must be
     logged in on the related file server.  If the requesting user is not
     logged in on the related file server, the function returns an empty
     array.

 <B>Example</B>

     Display all the user groups to which user KEITH on file server STONES
     belongs:

     aList:=NNETINGRPS('KEITH','STONES')
     FOR i = 1 TO LEN(aList)
     ? aList[i]
     NEXT i
