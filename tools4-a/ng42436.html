 <B>NNETCAPJOB()</B>
 Determines the job number of the most recently opened capture job
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETCAPJOB([&lt;nPrinterNo&gt;]) --&gt; nJob</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Argument</B>

     <B>&lt;nPrinterNo&gt;</B>  Designates the LPT device for which the job number is
     determined.  LPT1 (1) to LPT3 (3) are possible.  The default value is 1.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETCAPJOB() returns the job number of the last opened capture job for
     &lt;nPrinterNo&gt;.  If an error occurs, the function returns 0.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET CAPTURE JOB
     To maintain the jobs within a queue, Netware internally uses job
     numbers.  The job number is a 16-bit integer.  This number has nothing
     to do with the logical position of a job within a queue; for example,
     the first job within a queue is not automatically job number 1.  The job
     number is assigned to a print job by the Queue Management Services (QMS)
     and cannot be foreseen.  It is only used to identify a job
     unambiguously.

     After a job has been created, the job number determined with
     NNETCAPJOB() can be used to access and manipulate specific jobs with the
     NNETJXXX() functions.  However, the start of a capture process with
     NNETCAPBEG() does not immediately create a job.  Therefore, a call of
     the function NNETCAPJOB() immediately after a call of NNETCAPBEG()
     returns the number of a job that was called earlier.  A new job is not
     created before the first output via the LPT device.  After the first
     output you can determine the number of the current job using
     NNETCAPJOB().

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Determine the job number of the last opened capture job on
        LPT2:

        ? NNETCAPJOB(2)

     <B>.</B>  Start the capture mode for LPT1, send output to the queue
        LINEPRINTER, and set the job description to "! CONFIDENTIAL !":

        NNETCAPSSF(1)
        NNETCAPBEG(1)
        NNETSETQ(1,'LINEPRINTER')
        SET PRINTER ON
        ? 'Hello'   // A new job is created!
        NNETJDESC('LINEPRINTER',NNETCAPJOB(1),'! CONFIDENTIAL !')
        NNETCAPFLU(1)
