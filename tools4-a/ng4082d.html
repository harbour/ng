 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions in this chapter cover the entire area of print queue
     control under Netware.  Print queues can be created or deleted.  Users,
     operators, and print servers for a print queue can be defined or
     removed.  The queue functions allow you to manipulate jobs within a
     queue.  All settings for a print job can be queried or modified if the
     job is not currently processed (provided that you have sufficient access
     rights).  Jobs can be deleted or moved within a queue.

     <B>Important!</B>  Within the Netware documentation the term "job" is used
     to describe a print job within a queue and also to describe a set of
     capture parameters (print job definition).  Within this chapter the term
     "job" only describes a print job.
