 <B>Introduction</B>

     Each Netware file server maintains a database of users and resources
     available on the network.  This special-purpose database is called the
     bindery.  The bindery contains objects uniquely specified by an object
     name and an object type.  Possible object types are: users, user groups,
     print queues, or print servers.  Each object has associated with it a
     number of properties that can be addressed with names and contain
     information about the object.  For example, the property GROUPS_I'M_IN
     contains a list of user groups of which a user is a member.

     The functions of this chapter allow a low level access to the bindery.
     This provides you with maximum flexibility for programming within
     Novell.  The low level functions allow the creation of your own bindery
     objects as well as the development of bindery analyzers.

     However, even though the bindery concept has a high security level,
     incorrect use of the low level bindery functions can be very dangerous
     if you have supervisor or equivalent access rights.  The network could
     be brought to a standstill.  You should use these functions only with
     extensive knowledge of the bindery concept, the Novell API, and bindery
     management.  For example, you must know the terms object, item, and set
     property.

     For frequent, complex purposes that require bindery access, like adding
     a user to a group, CA-Clipper Tools provides high level functions that
     can be used without a problem.  These functions are based on the low
     level functions and are available in CA-Clipper source code.

     Netware internally uses a high low sequence to store numeric values,
     which is contrary to the standard format of the 80x86 processor family
     (low high sequence).  For efficiency reasons, the Netware functions of
     CA-Clipper Tools expect numeric values that are passed to Netware
     (object types or object IDs) in the high low sequence.  However, this
     will not affect the practical work with the CA-Clipper Tools because
     symbolic constants are defined in the high-low format in the header file
     CTNNET.CH for the most important object types.
