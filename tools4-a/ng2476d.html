 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions of this chapter allow the start and termination of capture
     processes from within a CA-Clipper application.  Additionally, the most
     important parameters for a capture process can be set.

     The Print Job Definition chapter can be substituted for these functions.
     When working with print job definitions you do not have to worry about
     the settings of capture processes.  You only have to activate a print
     job definition that can be created and maintained with the Novell
     utility PRINTCON.EXE.
