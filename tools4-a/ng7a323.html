 <B>NNETTTSSTA()</B>
 Determines the transaction status after completion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETTTSSTA(&lt;nTransNumber&gt;,[&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;])</B>
     <B>    --&gt; lWritten</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nTransNumber&gt;</B>  Designates a transaction number, which has been
     returned by NNETTTSEND() at the end of a transaction.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B> Designates the name of the file server that is used.  Your
     workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETTTSSTA() returns .T. if a terminated transaction has been written
     completely.  If the terminated transaction has not been written
     completely, the function returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET TRANSACTION TRACKING SYSTEM STATUS
     A few seconds after a transaction has been terminated by NNETTTSEND(),
     Netware starts writing the transaction.  NNETTTSSTA() allows you to
     determine if a transaction that has been completed successfully is
     already written.  The first parameter that is passed contains the
     transaction number that has been returned by NNETTTSEND().

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  When you use the Transaction Tracking System (TTS), always
        take into account that other stations might not be able to read files
        attached by the transaction (see the Introduction to this chapter).

 <B>Example</B>

     Terminate the transaction, and wait until the transaction has been
     written completely:

     nTrans=NNETTTSEND()

     WHILE !NNETTTSSTA(nTrans)
     ENDDO
