 <B>Introduction</B>

     This chapter provides functions that return information about the
     connection between workstations and file servers and allow you to set up
     or terminate connections.  Even the login of a user from within a
     CA-Clipper application is possible.  With the functions in this chapter,
     you can create a list of file servers within the internal network and
     all attached file servers, and you can determine the network address of
     a workstation.

     <B>Important!</B>  The term "attach" in conjunction with CA-Clipper Tools
     only describes the setup of a logical connection between a workstation
     and a file server and does not include a login, as is the case with the
     Novell utility ATTACH.EXE.
