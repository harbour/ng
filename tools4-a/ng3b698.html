 <B>NNETMSGOPN()</B>
 Initializes the interrupt-controlled broadcast system
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETMSGOPN([&lt;nNumber&gt;]) --&gt; lStatus</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Argument</B>

     <B>&lt;nNumber&gt;</B>  Designates the maximum number of broadcast messages that
     are accepted by the receiving buffer.  Values from 1 to 1000 are
     allowed.  Values outside of this range are corrected automatically.  The
     default value for &lt;nNumber&gt; is 1.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETMSGOPEN() returns .T. if the broadcast system has been initialized
     successfully.  If an error occurs (for example, insufficient fixed heap
     memory to create the buffer), the function returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET MESSAGE BUFFER OPEN
     Netware allows you to send broadcast messages between workstations.  For
     example, broadcast messages can be created with the Novell utility SEND
     or with the CA-Clipper Tools function NNETSND().  The broadcast system
     is also used by Netware servers to send system messages.  Incoming
     messages are displayed on line 24 of the screen; these messages block
     the system until they are confirmed with &lt;Ctrl&gt; &lt;Return&gt;.  These
     incoming messages can be suppressed with CASTOFF or with the CA-Clipper
     Tools function NNETBRDCST().  In contrast, NNETMSGOPN(), in conjunction
     with the NNETSND() functions, allows communication between applications.

     NNETMSGOPN() opens a buffer that can accept up to &lt;nNumber&gt; broadcast
     messages and installs an interrupt handler.  After the message system
     has been installed, incoming messages are no longer displayed on the
     screen; these messages are stored in the internal message buffer.  The
     messages can then be read from the buffer in the sequence of their
     arrival with NNETMSGRD().

     The broadcast system can simulate a key code when a message is received.
     If the receiving buffer is full, no additional messages are accepted.
     Do not suppress the receiving of messages when using the broadcast
     system!  Messages are already suppressed on the file server instead of
     the workstation.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>Important!</B>  NNETMSGOPN() works with the interrupt system.  Before
     you leave your CA-Clipper application, NNETMSGOPN() must be uninstalled
     with the function NNETMSGCLO().  Changed interrupt vectors can, sooner
     or later, lead to a system crash.  When working with the extended
     drivers module, interrupt vectors are reset automatically.

     <B>.</B>  It is not possible to use the message system with former
        versions of the Novell shell.  The latest version is available free
        of charge from Novell through CompuServe.

 <B>Example</B>

     Install the broadcast system with a buffer for up to 10 messages:

     IF NNETMSGOPN(10)
     ? 'Broadcast system installed successfully!'
     ELSE
     ? 'Installation failed!'
     ENDIF
