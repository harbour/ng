 <B>NNETJPOINT()</B>
 Determines if a job is serviced at an interrupt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJPOINT(&lt;cQueue&gt;,&lt;nJob&gt;,[&lt;lNewMode&gt;],[&lt;cServer&gt;|</B>
     <B>   &lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; lMode</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;nJob&gt;</B>  Designates the job number of the job that is processed in
     &lt;cQueue&gt;.

     <B>&lt;lNewMode&gt;</B>  Designates an optional parameter that specifies if
     &lt;nJob&gt; is serviced by a print server when the job file has not been
     closed correctly.  If the parameter is designated .T., the QMS submits
     &lt;nJob&gt; to a print server.  If the parameter is set to .F., QMS discards
     the &lt;nJob&gt; when the job file has not been closed correctly.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The return value of NNETJPOINT() indicates whether a job is printed
     (.T.) or discarded (.F.) when the job file has not been closed
     correctly.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB PRINT ON INTERRUPT
     NNETJPOINT() allows you to determine whether or not a job is printed
     when the job file has not been closed correctly.  To query the current
     setting for &lt;nJob&gt;, do not pass a value for &lt;lNewMode&gt;.

     The required job is specified by its job number.  The job number has
     nothing to do with the logical position of a job within a queue; for
     example, the job with the highest priority in a queue is not
     automatically job number 1.  The job number must be determined with
     NNETCAPJOB() or NNETJLIST().

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Determine if the first job in the queue LINEPRINTER is printed
        when the job file has not been closed correctly:

        nJob=BIN2I(SUBSTR(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),5,2))
        ? NNETJPOINT('LINEPRINTER', nJob)

     <B>.</B>  Determine that the first job in the queue LINEPRINTER is
        printed when the job file has not been closed correctly:

        nJob=BIN2I(SUBSTR(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),5,2))
        ? NNETJPOINT('LINEPRINTER', nJob, .T.)
