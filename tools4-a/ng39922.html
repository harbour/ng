 <B>NNETBRDCST()</B>
 Determines or queries the receiving mode for broadcast messages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETBRDCST([&lt;nMode&gt;]) --&gt; nPrevMode</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Argument</B>

     <B>&lt;nMode&gt;</B>  Designates the new mode for receiving broadcast messages.
     Values from 0 to 3 are accepted.

     <B>Table 24.1:  Broadcast Receiving Modes</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Value   Sym. Con.      Definition</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     0       BRD_RECALL     Receive all messages automatically
     1       BRD_RECSERVER  Receive server messages only, discard other
                            messages
     2       BRD_STORESERV  Store one server message on the server, discard
                            other messages
     3       BRD_STOREALL   Store any message on the server
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETBRDCST() returns a numeric value between 0 and 3.  The value
     represents the broadcast mode at the moment of the call of NNETBRDCST(),
     before a new mode is set (see the argument).  With NNETBRDCST(), you can
     save the previous mode and set a new mode.  A return value of -1
     indicates an error.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET BROADCAST MODE
     With NNETBRDCST(), you can set the mode for receiving broadcast
     messages.  Broadcast messages can be sent by a file server (system
     messages or the shutdown of a server) or by any workstation within the
     network (user messages set up with the Novell SEND utility or a
     NNETSND()).  When a message is received, the network shell usually
     interrupts the running application, displays the message in line 24 of
     the screen and waits for a user input (&lt;Ctrl&gt; &lt;Enter&gt;).  This behavior
     can be modified by using the function NNETBRDCST().  Four different
     receiving modes are available (see the argument).  Modes 0 and 1 allow
     the interruption of an application; however, mode 1 ignores user
     messages.  Modes 2 and 3 suppress the display of messages on the screen
     during an application.  The file server has a message buffer available
     for each connected workstation.  As soon as the buffer is full,
     additional messages are ignored.  Messages can be read with the function
     NNETGETMSG().

     Alternatively, the broadcast system of CA-Clipper Tools can be activated
     (see NNETMSGOPN()).  This system allows the interrupt controlled
     receiving of broadcast messages in the background.  Messages can be
     processed within an application, and the computer is not interrupted by
     incoming messages.

 <B>Example</B>

     Suppress incoming messages at program start, and reset to the previous
     mode after the end of the application:

     // Program start
     #include "ctnnet.ch"

     nOldMsg=NNETBRDCST(BRD_STOREALL)
     ....
     // End of program
     NNETBRDCST(nOldMsg)
     RETURN
