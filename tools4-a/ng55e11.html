 <B>Introduction</B>

     With the Novell utility PRINTCON.EXE, print job definitions that contain
     the settings for a capture process can be created.  The functions in
     this chapter allow you to control the print job definitions of the
     current users and all other users on a file server.  You can create new
     job definitions and query or modify settings in existing definitions.
     It is possible to read the settings of a job definition and to directly
     start a capture process (NNETPJCAPF()).  This function call is
     equivalent to a call of the CAPTURE utility with the parameter /J=.

     <B>Important!</B>  Within the Netware documentation the term "job" is used
     to describe a print job within a queue and also a set of capture
     parameters (print job definition).  Within this chapter the term "job"
     or "job definition" only describes the definition of capture parameters.
