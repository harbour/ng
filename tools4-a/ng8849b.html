 <B>NBSCALL()</B>
 Opens a NetBIOS session sending and receiving buffer and attempts a
 connection setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NBSCALL(&lt;cSourceName&gt;,[&lt;nRecBuffer&gt;],[&lt;nSendBuffer&gt;],</B>
     <B>   &lt;cTargetName&gt;,[&lt;nPacket&gt;],[&lt;nRecTimeout&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;nSendTimeout&gt;]) --&gt; nHandle</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cSourceName&gt;</B>  Designates the NetBIOS name of the communication's
     transmitting side.

     <B>&lt;nRecBuffer&gt;</B>  Designates the selected size of the receiving buffer.
     If no value is passed for &lt;nRecBuffer&gt;, no receiving buffer is
     established.  The minimum size of the receiving buffer is &lt;nPacket&gt;.  If
     the value for &lt;nRecBuffer&gt; is too small, it is changed automatically by
     NBSCALL().  The maximum size of the receiving buffer is 64 KByte.

     <B>&lt;nSendBuffer&gt;</B>  Designates the selected size of the sending buffer.
     If no value is passed for &lt;nSendBuffer&gt;, no sending buffer is
     established.  The minimum size of the sending buffer is &lt;nPacket&gt;.  If
     the value for &lt;nSendBuffer&gt; is too small, it is changed automatically by
     NBSCALL().  The maximum size of the sending buffer is 64 KByte.

     <B>&lt;cTargetName&gt;</B>  Designates a NetBIOS name that specifies the target
     station.

     <B>&lt;nPacket&gt;</B>  Designates the packet size of the data that is sent in
     bytes.  The default value is 512 Bytes.

     <B>&lt;nRecTimeout&gt;</B>  Designates the timeout for the following receiving
     operations in 1/2 seconds.  The default value (0) designates no timeout.

     <B>&lt;nSendTimeout&gt;</B>  Designates the timeout for the following sending
     operations in 1/2 seconds.  The default value (0) designates no timeout.

 <B>Returns</B>

     If an operation is successful, NBSCALL() returns a communication handle.
     The return value contains a numeric value that is greater than 0.  You
     should store the handle in a variable because all further operations
     that refer to an established buffer require a communication handle.  If
     an error occurs, the function returns 0.

 <B>Description</B>

     NBSCALL() allows you to establish a communication buffer for a NetBIOS
     session communication with other workstations in the network.  The
     communication buffer can contain the sending and receiving buffer
     through which the interrupt controlled sending and receiving of data is
     processed.

     &lt;nSourceName&gt; is the NetBIOS name of the process that transmits the data
     (see the Introduction to this chapter).  The name can be added to the
     local name table with the functions NBADDNAME() or NBADDGROUP() before
     the call of NBSCALL().  If &lt;nSourceName&gt; has not been added to the name
     table, it is added by NBSCALL() automatically.

     The parameters &lt;nRecBuffer&gt; and &lt;nSendBuffer&gt; determine the size of
     receiving and sending buffers.  The buffers are automatically designed
     for one NetBIOS packet.  Each buffer can be up to 64 KByte.  However,
     the size of the buffer that is allocated by NBSCALL() depends on the
     application and the configuration of the computer used.

     The parameter &lt;cTargetName&gt; is mandatory.  The session is set up with
     the station specified by &lt;cTargetName&gt;.

     &lt;nPacket&gt; determines the maximum size of the data range of the NetBIOS
     packets that are sent or received.  The maximum value (and the default
     value) is 512 bytes.  Smaller packets can be sent without failure.
     However, larger packets are discarded.  The value of &lt;nPacket&gt; is also
     valid for use in sending data.

     The seconds for the timeout are not determined individually for each
     sending and receiving operation.  The timeout is set when the session is
     opened by passing the parameters &lt;nRecTimeout&gt; and &lt;nSendTimeout&gt;.  The
     parameters can contain numeric values that specify the timeout in steps
     of 1/2 second.

     If all parameters have been passed correctly and the buffers have been
     established successfully, NBSCALL() attempts to set up a session between
     the current workstation and the target station.  However, the target
     station must expect the connection setup.  If a CA-Clipper application
     is running on the target station, the function NBSLISTCON() must have
     been called.  If no acknowledgment is returned by the target station
     within the specified timeout, NBSCALL() releases the reserved buffers
     and returns 0.

     After a successful connection setup NBSCALL() returns a communication
     handle  that is greater than 0.  If a value has been passed for
     &lt;nRecBuffer&gt;, NBSCALL() initiates an interrupt controlled receiving
     mechanism that receives incoming packets in the background and then
     copies them to a receiving buffer.  The data can then be read with the
     PPCREAD() function within a CA-Clipper application.  If the receiving
     buffer is full, incoming data is discarded without notifying the sender.
     Data should be removed from the receiving buffer and processed as soon
     as possible.   You should either read the contents of the buffer
     periodically (polling) or supervise the buffer on an event-oriented
     basis: for example, with the function PPCKEY().

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Unlike a NetBIOS datagram communication, a NetBIOS session
        communication is connection-oriented.  A connection is established
        between two stations.  As long as no error occurs, a successful
        delivery of sent packets is guaranteed.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Attempt to set up a NetBIOS session connection to workstation
        MIKE.  If the setup is successful, a 5000 byte receiving buffer and a
        1000 byte sending buffer are established.  The source name on the
        local workstation is KEITH:

        nHandle=NBSCALL("MICK",5000,1000,"MIKE")
        IF nHandle=0
           ? 'Failure!'
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  The destination side can wait for the connection with the
        following call:

        nHandle:=NBSLISTCON("MIKE",2000,2000)
