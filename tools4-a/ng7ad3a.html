 <B>Introduction</B>

     This chapter contains some useful functions that do not belong in any
     other chapter of network functions.  The functions HEXTOSTR() and
     STRTOHEX() are not network functions, but these functions have been
     included in CA-Clipper Tools specifically for working with internet
     addresses that are returned or are required by functions such as
     NNETADR() or IPXOPEN().  The function NNETVER() is very useful if you
     are developing applications that access Netware 2.2 and Netware 3.11
     servers because the behavior of some CA-Clipper Tools functions depends
     on the Netware version used (for example, NNETRIGHTS(), NNETPURGE()).
     Other functions are available for only one Netware version (for example,
     NNETSNDLOG(), NNETSALLST()).
