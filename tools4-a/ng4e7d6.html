 <B>NNETJSTIME()</B>
 Queries or sets the job start time
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJSTIME(&lt;cQueue&gt;,&lt;nJob&gt;,[&lt;cNew&gt;],[&lt;cServer&gt;|</B>
     <B>   &lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; cTime</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;nJob&gt;</B>  Designates the job number of the job that is processed in
     &lt;cQueue&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cNew&gt;</B>  Designates a new job start time for &lt;nJob&gt;.  The time must
     be passed as a string in the form ("HH:MM:SS").

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETJSTIME() returns the earliest time for &lt;nJob&gt; in &lt;cQueue&gt; as a
     string in the form ("HH:MM:SS").  The function returns an empty string
     ("  :  :  ") if the job start time has not been set or if an error
     occurs (for example, if &lt;cQueue&gt; does not exist).

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB START DATE
     The Queue Management System (QMS) allows you to provide each job with a
     retention period.  A job is not serviced before the specified time (job
     start time).  With NNETJSTIME(), you can query or set the job start time
     of &lt;nJob&gt; in &lt;cQueue&gt;.  The required job is specified by its job number.
     The job number has nothing to do with the logical position of a job
     within a queue; for example, the job with the highest priority in a
     queue is not automatically job number 1.  The job number must be
     determined with NNETCAPJOB() or NNETJLIST().

     NNETJSTIME() returns the job start time.  An empty string indicates that
     no time has been set.  In this case, the job is serviced as soon as a
     print server is available.  ( An empty string can also indicate an
     error.  A differentiation is possible with the NNETERROR() function.)

     A new job start time can be set by passing a time with the &lt;dNew&gt;
     parameter.  If &lt;dNew&gt; contains an empty time string ("  :  :  "), a
     previously set job start date is removed.  If you reset a job start
     time, the job start date is removed automatically.

     To avoid an incorrect interpretation by the QMS of a date that has not
     been initialized, always set a job start date with the job start time.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  To determine a job start time, the requesting user must have
        access to the queue as a user or an operator.  The modification of a
        job start time is reserved for the user who created the job or for
        queue operators.

     <B>.</B>  A job that is already in progress cannot be modified.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Query the job start time for the first job in the queue
        LINEPRINTER:

        nJob=BIN2I(LEFT(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),2))
        ? NNETJSTIME('LINEPRINTER',nJob)

     <B>.</B>  Create the capture job, set the job start date for the
        following day, and set the job start time for 10 PM:

        NNETCAPSSF(1)
        NNETCAPBEG(1)
        NNETSETQ(1,'LINEPRINTER')
        SET PRINTER ON
        ? 'Hello'
        nJob=NNETCAPJOB(1)
        NNETJSDATE('LINEPRINTER',nJob,DATE()+1)
        NNETJSTIME('LINEPRINTER',nJob,'22:00:00')
        NNETCAPFLU(1)

     <B>.</B>  The new job is always created at the first output (? "Hello"),
        not by calling NNETCAPBEG().  Therefore, NNETJSTIME() must be called
        after the first output.  If NNETJSTIME() is not called after the
        first output, NNETCAPJOB() returns the number of the previous capture
        job and the job start date is modified for the wrong job.

     <B>.</B>  Remove the retention period for the first job in the queue
        LINEPRINTER (date and time):

        nJob=BIN2I(LEFT(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),2))
        ? NNETJSDATE('LINEPRINTER',nJob,('  :  :  '))
