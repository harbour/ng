 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions in this chapter provide access to the Netware broadcast
     message system.  With the utility SEND, Netware allows you to send
     messages between workstations.  The NNETSN() functions of CA-Clipper
     Tools make it possible to send messages from within a CA-Clipper
     application.

     Each Netware user knows the problem of getting a message during a
     running application: the application is usually interrupted when a
     message is received.  CA-Clipper Tools provide two possibilities to
     solve this problem: suppressing incoming messages with the NNETBRDCST()
     function (corresponding to the Novell utility CASTOFF) or using the
     CA-Clipper Tools broadcast system.  The broadcast system allows you to
     receive messages in the background and read the messages later from the
     broadcast buffer.
