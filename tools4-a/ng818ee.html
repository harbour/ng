 <B>IPXOPEN()</B>
 Opens the IPX sending and receiving buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>IPXOPEN(&lt;nSourceSocket&gt;,[&lt;nRecBuffer&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [[&lt;nSendBuffer&gt;],[&lt;cTargetAddr&gt;]],</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nSourceSocket&gt;</B>  Designates the number of the communication's source
     socket.

     <B>&lt;nRecBuffer&gt;</B>  Designates the selected size of the receiving buffer.
     If no value is passed for &lt;nRecBuffer&gt;, no receiving buffer is
     established.  The minimum size of the receiving buffer is &lt;nPacket&gt;.  If
     the value for &lt;nRecBuffer&gt; is too small, it is changed automatically by
     IPXOPEN().  The maximum size of the receiving buffer is 64 KByte.

     <B>&lt;nSendBuffer&gt;</B>  Designates the selected size of the sending buffer.
     If no value is passed for &lt;nSendBuffer&gt;, no sending buffer is
     established.  The minimum size of the sending buffer is &lt;nPacket&gt;.  If
     the value for &lt;nSendBuffer&gt; is too small, it is changed automatically by
     IPXOPEN().  The maximum size of the sending buffer is 64 KByte.

     <B>&lt;cTargetAddr&gt;</B>  Designates the target address for the sending
     operations.  The target address is a 20-character string that represents
     a 10-character hexadecimal byte sequence.  The leading eight characters
     of &lt;cTargetAddr&gt; specify the network number of the target.  The
     following 12 characters contain the station ID of the target station
     (node address).  &lt;cTargetAddr&gt; is mandatory to establish a sending
     buffer.

     <B>&lt;nTargetSocket&gt;</B>  Designates the number of the communication's target
     socket.  The default value is &lt;nSourceSocket&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nPacket&gt;</B>  Designates the packet size in bytes of the data that is
     sent.  The packet size can be between 1 and 546 bytes.  Values outside
     this range are changed automatically.  The default value is 546 Bytes.

     <B>&lt;lHeader&gt;</B>  Designates whether the data and the header (.T.), or the
     data (.F.) alone, are transmitted to the receiving buffer.

 <B>Returns</B>

     If an operation is successful, IPXOPEN() returns a communication handle.
     The return value contains a numeric value that is greater than 0.  You
     should store the handle in a variable because all further operations
     that refer to an established buffer require a communication handle.  If
     an error occurs, the function returns 0.

 <B>Description</B>

     IPXOPEN() allows you to establish a communication buffer for an IPX
     communication with other workstations in the network.  The communication
     buffer can contain a sending and receiving buffer through which data is
     processed.

     &lt;nSourceSocket&gt; is the socket address of the process that transmits the
     data (see the Introduction to this chapter).  The socket can be opened
     with the function OPENSOCK() before the call of IPXOPEN().  If
     &lt;nSourceSocket&gt; has not been opened, it is automatically opened by
     IPXOPEN().  If &lt;nSourceSocket&gt; is passed with 0, IPXOPEN() opens an
     available socket.

     The parameters &lt;nRecBuffer&gt; and &lt;nSendBuffer&gt; determine the size of the
     receiving and sending buffers.  The buffers are automatically designed
     for one IPX packet.  Each buffer can be up to 64 KByte.  However, the
     size of the buffer that is allocated by IPXOPEN() depends on the
     application and the configuration of the computer used.

     The parameter &lt;cTargetAddr&gt; is mandatory to establish a sending buffer.
     All following sending operations are addressed to &lt;cTargetAddr&gt;.
     Remember that an IPX communication is implemented as a pseudo Point-To-
     Point communication.  Data is received by any station addressed to the
     current workstation but is sent only to a defined target address.  The
     target address must be passed as a 20- character string (for example,
     "4921750400001B025A99"), where two characters represent one byte in
     hexadecimal code.

     If the current workstation is logged in to a Netware server, the
     destination's network address can be determined with NNETADR() , using
     the user name.  However, the target workstation must be logged in.
     Under Netware Lite, the leading eight characters of &lt;cTargetAddr&gt; must
     be passed with 0.  A character string consisting of
     "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF" specifies all stations within an internal network
     as the target address (broadcast packages).

     &lt;nTargetSocket&gt; allows you to determine the communication's target
     socket.  The default value is &lt;nSourceSocket&gt;.

     &lt;nPacket&gt; determines the maximum size of the data range of the IPX
     packets that are sent or received.  The maximum value (and the default
     value) is 564 bytes.  The value of &lt;nPacket&gt; is also valid for sending
     data.

     With &lt;lHeader&gt; you can determine if the header (30 bytes) of an IPX
     packet is transmitted to the receiving buffer.  The header can contain
     important information about the received packet.  For a description
     about the header structure, see the Introduction to this chapter.

     If the buffer has been established successfully, IPXOPEN() returns an
     integer value that is greater than 0, called a communication handle.  If
     a value has been passed for &lt;nRecBuffer&gt;, IPXOPEN() initiates an
     interrupt controlled receiving mechanism that receives incoming packets
     in the background and then copies to an receiving buffer.  The data can
     then be read with the PPCREAD() function within a CA-Clipper
     application.  If the receiving buffer is full, incoming data is
     discarded without notifying the sender.  Data should be removed from the
     receiving buffer and processed as soon as possible.  You should either
     read the contents of the buffer periodically (polling) or supervise the
     buffer on an event-oriented basis: for example, with the function
     PPCKEY().

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  IPX is a protocol that is not based on a connection.  There is
        no guarantee or verification of a successful delivery to the target
        workstation.  The implementation of specific protocols with the aid
        of CA-Clipper Tools functions can be necessary.  (For your
        information: Netware usually uses IPX communication, and Netware Lite
        exclusively uses IPX communication, which is now available under
        CA-Clipper with the IPXOPEN() function.)

     <B>.</B>  Several communication buffers can be established for one
        source socket.  However, you cannot know when you establish the
        communication buffers how the data will be distributed to the
        receiving buffers.

     <B>.</B>  Network addresses can be determined under Netware with
        "USERLIST /A", and under Netware Lite with "NET ULIST".

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Open the 5 KByte IPX receiving buffer for socket 20000:

        nHandle=IPXOPEN(20000,5120)
        IF nHandle=0
           ? 'Buffer could not be established!'
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  Open the 2 KByte IPX sending buffer for socket 20000.  The
        target address is "4921750400001B025A99":

        nHandle=IPXOPEN(20000,,2048,"4921750400001B025A99")

     <B>.</B>  Open the 1 KByte IPX sending and receiving buffer for socket
        20000.  The target address is the first workstation where user MIKE
        is currently logged in:

        nHandle=IPXOPEN(20000,1024,1024,NNETADR("MIKE"))

     <B>.</B>  For this example, the current workstation must be logged into
        a file server.  As NNETADR() is based on Netware-API, this call
        cannot be used under Netware Lite.
