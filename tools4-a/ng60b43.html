 <B>Introduction</B>

     Under Netware 3.x, control of network printers is no longer handled by a
     file server but by a print server.  (However, as an NLM, the print
     server can also run on a file server.)  Under Netware 2.2, a print
     server VAP is available.  The functions of this chapter provide the
     ability to access the most important information and functions of a
     print server.  For example, you can determine the status of a print
     server printer.  In conjunction with the functions for Point To Point
     communication, a CA-Clipper application is able to emulate a remote
     printer (see sample program RPRINTER.PRG).
