 <B>NNETLOGIN()</B>
 Log in a user on a file server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETLOGIN(&lt;cName&gt;,&lt;cPassword&gt;,[&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;])</B>
     <B>    --&gt; nConId</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cName&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the user that is logged in.

     <B>&lt;cPassword&gt;</B>  Designates the corresponding password.  If no password
     is required, an empty string must be passed.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which the user
     is logged in.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of the workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.  A connection ID can be passed only if the file server is
     attached to the workstation.

 <B>Returns</B>

     If a user has been logged in successfully, NNETLOGIN() returns a value
     between 1 and 8.  This value represents the connection ID that can be
     used to address the file server on the workstation.  If an error occurs,
     the function returns 0.

 <B>Description</B>

     NNETLOGIN() allows you to log in a user on a file server within an
     application.  The file server must not be attached when you call this
     function.  When NNETLOGIN() is first called, it automatically attaches
     the workstation to &lt;cServer&gt;.  If no server is specified, the function
     tries to log in the user on the default server.

     If a user at the requesting workstation is already logged in on the
     related file server, this user is logged out automatically.  The log out
     is performed even if the name of the logged in user is identical to the
     user name passed with NNETLOGIN().  If the attempt to log in is
     unsuccessful (for example, because of an incorrect password), the
     previous log in is canceled.  Any drives mapped to the related file
     server are deleted and are not restored even if the log in is
     successful.

     <B>Important!</B>  Before you attempt to log in on file servers where a
     user is already logged in on the current workstation, make sure that all
     files on the volumes of the related file server are closed correctly.

     A return value that is greater than 0 indicates that the log in has been
     successful.  The value can be stored in a variable and used later to
     identify the required file server.  Alternatively, the identification of
     the server is possible with the server name.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The password is case sensitive.

     <B>.</B>  If the log in is unsuccessful (for example, because of an
        invalid password or user name), the server remains attached.

     <B>.</B>  The function does not execute a login script.  To get a login
        script, the function must be called.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Log in Paul on server NANGERTOOLS2:

        IF (nConId:= NNETLOGIN('PAUL','190366','NANGERTOOLS2'))&gt;0
        ? 'Login successful!'
        ELSE
        ? 'Login failed!'
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  Log in on an attached server:

        IF (nConId:=NNETATTACH('NANGERTOOLS2'))&gt;0
        NNETLOGIN('PAUL','190366',nConId)
        ENDIF
