     <B>&lt;nConnect&gt;</B> Designates the connection number that is cleared.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B> Designates the name of the file server that is used.  Your

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

     NNETCLRCON() returns .T. if &lt;nConnect&gt; has been cleared successfully.
     If an error occurs, the function returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET CLEAR CONNECTION
     When a workstation is first attached to a server, the Netware file
     server returns a connection number (connection ID) to the workstation.
     The file server keeps the connection ID even after a logout and is
     assigned to the related workstation at the next connection setup.
     However, the connection ID is changed, if all connection numbers are
     used.  In this case, the connection ID can be assigned to another
     workstation. NNETCLRCON() allows you to clear used connection numbers.

     <B>Important! </B> If the connection &lt;nConnect&gt; is currently active, it is
     interrupted immediately.  This can lead to data loss on the related
     workstation, as all drive mappings become invalid and the writing of
     data to the server is no longer possible.

     Supervisor rights on the related file server are required to clear a
     connection.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  This function should be used very carefully as data loss is
        possible if &lt;nConnect&gt; is currently active.

 <B>Example</B>

     Determine the connection ID of the user MICK, and clear the connection
     (ATTENTION: MICK will be logged out):

     NNETCLRCON(NNETSTANUM('MICK'))
