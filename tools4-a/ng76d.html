 <B>Introduction</B>

     This chapter includes network functions for IBM PC LAN/Microsoft MS-NET
     software.

 <B>PC LAN/MS-NET</B>

     PC LAN/MS-NET is software that has been offered for networks by IBM and
     Microsoft.  Both programs are based upon the NETBIOS protocol;
     CA-Clipper does not directly affect the NETBIOS protocol.  All internal
     function calls to the network software occur under DOS, which requires
     version 3.1 or higher.  The functions in this group are in the format
     NETXXX().

     An exception is the NETDISK() function.  It can also determine whether a
     drive is local or remote under other network software.  This assumes
     that the network software properly supports DOS in the background.
