 <B>NNETJLIST()</B>
 Determines a list of job numbers in a queue
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJLIST(&lt;cQueue&gt;,[&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; cJobNum</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETJLIST() returns a string in form of a byte sequence that contains
     the job numbers of the jobs in &lt;cQueue&gt;.  Two bytes correspond to one
     job number.  If an error occurs (for example, if &lt;cQueue&gt; does not
     exist), the function returns an empty string.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB LIST
     Netware internally uses job numbers in form of 16-bit integers for the
     administration of jobs within a queue.  The job number has nothing to do
     with the logical position of a job within a queue; for example, the
     first job in a queue is not automatically job number 1.  The job number
     is assigned to a job by the Queue Management System (QMS) when the job
     is placed in the queue.  Job numbers are used only to identify a job
     unambiguously.

     You must know the job number to work with the functions (NNETJXXX()).
     NNETJLIST() returns the job numbers in a queue as a string where two
     bytes contain one job number. With the functions SUBSTR() and BIN2I(),
     you can extract each job number (see the example).  The sequence of the
     job numbers in the string corresponds to the logical job sequence.  The
     first two bytes represent the job with the highest priority in the
     queue.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  This function requires that the requesting user have access to
        the queue as a user or an operator.

 <B>Example</B>

     Determine and output the job numbers for the queue LINEPRINTER:

     cJobs=NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER')
     FOR i= 0 TO LEN(cJobs)/2-1
     ? BIN2I(SUBSTR(cJobs,2*i+1,2))
     NEXT i
