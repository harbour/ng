 <B>NNETTTSBEG()</B>
 Starts an explicit transaction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETTTSBEG([&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; lSuccess</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B> Designates the name of the file server that is used.  Your
     workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETTTSBEG() returns .T. if a transaction on &lt;cServer&gt; has been opened
     successfully.  If an error occurs, the function returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET TRANSACTION TRACKING SYSTEM BEGIN
     A call of NNETTTSBEG() starts an explicit transaction on &lt;cServer&gt;.
     After a transaction has been started, each write access to a marked,
     transactional file (the extended attribute transactional is set) is
     protocolled and becomes valid if the transaction is terminated.  During
     a running transaction, all file modifications can be undone.  If a
     failure occurs during a transaction (for example, a workstation crash),
     the Transactional Tracking System (TTS) backs up the transaction
     immediately.

     Only one transaction can be active per workstation.  This transaction
     includes all transactional files into which the data is written.

     A file on a server volume can be marked 'transactional' with
     NNETEXTATT().

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  When you use the TTS, always take into account that other
        stations might not be able to read files attached by the transaction
        (see the Introduction to this chapter).

 <B>Example</B>

     Mark the file CLIENT.DBF as transactional, and start an explicit
     transaction:

     #include "ctnnet.ch"

     NNETEXTATT('CLIENT.DBF',EXA_TTS)

     IF .NOT. NNETTTSBEG()
        ? 'Transaction could not be started!'
     ENDIF
