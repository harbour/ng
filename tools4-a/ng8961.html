 <B>NNETDELSET()</B>
 Deletes a bindery object from a set property
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETDELSET(&lt;cName&gt;,[&lt;nType&gt;],&lt;cProperty&gt;,&lt;cMember&gt;,</B>
     <B>   [&lt;cMemberType&gt;],[&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; lSuccess</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cName&gt; </B> Designates the name of the bindery object that is
     processed.

     <B>&lt;nType&gt; </B> Designates a numeric value that indicates the type of
     &lt;cName&gt;.  The header file CTNNET.CH contains symbolic constants for the
     object types defined by Novell for use with the bindery functions of
     CA-Clipper Tools.  The default value indicates the object type OBJ_USER.

     <B>&lt;cProperty&gt; </B> Designates the name of a set property of &lt;cName&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cMember&gt; </B> Designates the name of the bindery object that is deleted
     from &lt;cProperty&gt; of the bindery object &lt;cName&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cMemberType&gt; </B> Designates a numeric value that specifies the type of
     &lt;cMember&gt;.  The default value is OBJ_USER.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt; </B> Designates the name of the file server for which the
     bindery is accessed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt; </B> Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETDELSET() returns .T. if the operation has been completed
     successfully.  If an error occurs, the Novell error code can be queried
     with the NNETERROR() function.

 <B>Description</B>

     <B>Important!</B>  NNETDELSET() is a low level bindery function and should
     be used only with extensive knowledge of the bindery concept and the
     Novell API.

     NOVELL NET DELETE BINDERY OBJECT FROM SET
     Internally, Novell Netware has defined two different property types:
     item and set properties. NNETDELSET() allows you to delete information
     from a set property.  A set property contains a list of references to
     other bindery objects.  An example is the GROUP_MEMBERS property that
     contains a list of users who are members of a user group.

     The parameters &lt;cName&gt; and &lt;cType&gt; identify the object, and &lt;cProperty&gt;
     is the name of the property.  &lt;cMember&gt; and &lt;cMemberType&gt; define the
     bindery object that is deleted from  &lt;cProperty&gt;.  With the parameters
     &lt;cServer&gt; or &lt;nConId&gt;, the bindery of any attached server can be
     accessed.  The connection ID of a server can be determined with
     NNETATTACH() or NNETLOGIN().

     To delete information from a property, sufficient bindery and property
     access rights are required.  The necessary property access rights depend
     on the property security of the property that is manipulated.  For
     efficiency reasons, user defined object types must be passed in the high-
     low format.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  NNETDELSET() deletes only the reference to the bindery object
        &lt;cMember&gt; from &lt;cProperty&gt;.  The object itself is not affected or
        deleted.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Delete user MIKE from the MARKET group:

        #include "ctnnet.ch"

        IF NNETDELSET('MARKET',OBJ_GROUP,'GROUP_MEMBERS','MIKE')
        ? 'User has been deleted from group!'

        ELSE
        ? 'User could not be deleted!'
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  To delete a user from a group, it is also necessary to delete
        the group from two user properties.  Use the function NNETREMGRP() to
        remove a user from a group.
