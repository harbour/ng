 <B>Novell Transaction Tracking System (TTS)</B>

     This chapter provides functions for the use of the TTS within a
     CA-Clipper application.  The use of the TTS within a CA-Clipper
     application requires more than start and termination or cancellation of
     a transaction with the related CA-Clipper Tools functions.  With regard
     to the architecture, the application must be oriented to the specifics
     of TTS.  The TTS takes into consideration only files managed on a server
     volume.

     Transaction tracking occurs only on the files that have been marked as
     transactional.  The transactional bit is an extended file attribute that
     can be set with the Novell utility FLAG.EXE or with the related
     CA-Clipper Tools function NNETEXTATT().  All files related to a .DBF
     file, (.NTX, .DBT) must also be marked as transactional.

     The time between the start and the termination or cancellation of a
     transaction should be as short as possible.  Avoid direct entries into
     database fields.  Use memory variables for data input and then update
     the database within a transaction.

     The reason for minimizing the transaction time is a characteristic of
     the Netware operating system that cannot be influenced by the
     application.  When data in a file is modified, Netware physically locks
     the affected file area.  In contrast to a logical locking with RLOCK(),
     the affected data cannot be read as long as the transaction is
     incomplete.  If the transaction has been terminated successfully, the
     database record is updated.  If the transaction has been interrupted,
     the record is reset to the previous value.  A successful read access by
     another workstation could lead to fatal logical errors.  The physical
     lock is removed automatically after the transaction has been completed
     or canceled.  If a workstation tries to access a physically locked area,
     CA-Clipper causes an ACCESS DENIED error message and evaluates the error
     block.  Normally, this results in a branch into the error recovery
     routine.  An error message box is displayed, and the user can cause a
     repetition of the operation that failed.  The error message text can be
     adapted to the running transaction.  However, the problem is that from
     the beginning the application is not able to determine whether the
     ACCESS DENIED error results from a running transaction or another error
     source.  Therefore, an application using the TTS should have a mechanism
     available that allows it to determine if a transaction is active for a
     specified group of files or not.  Using Netware semaphores, for example,
     allows you to check to see if a transaction is active, either during the
     error recovery or before a file is accessed.
