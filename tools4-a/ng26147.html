 <B>NNETCAPFLU()</B>
 Closes the current print job and dispatches it
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETCAPFLU(&lt;nPrinter&gt;) --&gt; lTransfer</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Argument</B>

     <B>&lt;nPrinter&gt;</B>  Designates the LPT device for which an active print job
     is closed and transferred to "service".  LPT1(1) to LPT3(3) are
     possible.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETCAPFLU() returns .T. when the print job has been transferred to
     "service".

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NETWORK CAPTURE FLUSH
     In CA-Clipper, print output occurs in the network when the application
     has been exited or the device has been closed.  To close the current
     print job and dispatch that job, you can set a timeout with the
     NNETCAPSSF() or use the NNETCAPFLU() function.

     If a timeout does not provide you with an acceptable solution, you can
     close a previously occurring print job using the NNETCAPFLU() function
     under Novell; the print job is transferred to "service".  Internally,
     this function corresponds to the END CAPTURE or START CAPTURE commands.
     Subsequent print output can occur in the network without calling
     NNETCAPBEG() again.

 <B>Example</B>

     Activate the capture mode for LPT1, and then stop it after the print
     output occurs:

     SET PRINTER TO LPT1
     ? NNETCAPBEG(1)               // .T. if active
     SET DEVICE TO PRINT
     ? "This is a test 234"
     SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
     EJECT
     NNETCAPFLU(1)                 // Terminate print job.
