 <B>NNETSNDGRP()</B>
 Sends a message to all group members
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETSNDGRP(&lt;cName&gt;,&lt;cMessage&gt;,[&lt;lNoSender&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;]) --&gt; nNumber</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cName&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the group that has members to which
     the message is sent.

     <B>&lt;cMessage&gt;</B>  Designates the message that is sent to the members of
     &lt;cName&gt;.  The message can be up to 55 characters long (including
     information about the sender) and can contain only characters that have
     an ASCII value between 32 and 127.

     <B>&lt;lNoSender&gt;</B>  Designates an optional parameter that allows you to
     suppress the sender information (from ...) when designated as (.T.).
     When this parameter is designated .F., the sender information is
     generated automatically.  The default value is .F..

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server through which the
     message is sent.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETSNDGRP() returns the number of workstations to which the message
     &lt;cMessage&gt; was successfully sent.  The function returns 0 if no member
     of &lt;cName&gt; is currently logged in or ready to receive messages..

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET SEND GROUP
     NNETSNDGRP() allows you to send a message of up to 55 characters to all
     the users of a group.  The function can be compared with the Novell
     utility SEND.  The group &lt;cName&gt; must exist either on the default server
     or on the server specified by &lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt; because the sending of
     messages is processed through a file server.  The message is sent to all
     workstations on which a member of &lt;cName&gt; is logged in and the message
     receipt is not disabled (castoff).  The message is displayed on line 24
     of the screen and must be confirmed with &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Return&gt;.  The message
     system of CA-Clipper Tools (NNETMSGOPN()) allows the interrupt
     controlled receipt of messages in the background.  The incoming messages
     can be processed within the application and the computer is not
     interrupted in critical moments.

     If the parameter &lt;lNoSender&gt; is set to .F. or if no parameter is set,
     the message contains information about the sender.   This information
     consists of the word "from", the name of the sender, and the connection
     ID.  By passing &lt;lNoSender&gt; with .T., the sender inforation can be
     suppressed.  With the parameters &lt;cServer&gt; or &lt;nConId&gt;, the message can
     be sent on any attached file server.  The connection ID of a server is
     returned by NNETATTACH() or NNETLOGIN().

 <B>Example</B>

     Send a message to all members of the group TOOLS:

     nNumber= NNETSNDGRP('TOOLS','Data backup in 5 minutes!')
     ? 'Message has been sent to '+NTOC(nNumber)+' stations!'
