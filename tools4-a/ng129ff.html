 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions of the User and Group Management chapter are based
     exclusively upon low level bindery accesses and could be accomplished
     completely with the low level bindery functions.  However, working with
     low level bindery functions can be dangerous (see the Introduction to
     the Low Level Bindery Access chapter).  Therefore, CA-Clipper Tools
     provide a number of high level functions for the most common
     requirements of user and group management.  The functions in this
     chapter allow you to add or remove users, or groups of users, to or from
     groups.  Various lists can be created: established users or groups,
     currently logged in users, members of a group, or groups of which a user
     is a member.  You can determine if a user is a member of a specified
     group.  For example, this allows you to combine the availibility of menu
     options with Netware settings.

     A number of functions in this chapter have been developed in CA-Clipper
     with the use of low level bindery functions.  The source code for these
     functions can be found on the product disks and can be used as an
     example for the use of the low level bindery functions.
