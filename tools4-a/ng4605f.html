 <B>NNETJDEL()</B>
 Deletes a job from a print queue
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>NNETJDEL(&lt;cQueue&gt;,&lt;nJob&gt;,[&lt;cServer&gt;|&lt;nConId&gt;])</B>
     <B>   --&gt; lSuccess</B>

     <B>Netware: 2.2 and 3.11</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cQueue&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the print queue that is accessed.

     <B>&lt;nJob&gt;</B>  Designates the job number of the job that is deleted from
     &lt;cQueue&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cServer&gt;</B>  Designates the name of the file server on which &lt;cQueue&gt;
     is processed.  Your workstation must be attached to &lt;cServer&gt;.

     <B>&lt;nConId&gt;</B>  Designates the connection ID of your workstation on
     &lt;cServer&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     NNETJDEL() returns .T. if the job has been deleted successfully.  If an
     error occurs, the function returns .F.  An error can occur if &lt;cQueue&gt;
     does not exist or the requesting user does not have the required access
     rights.

 <B>Description</B>

     NOVELL NET JOB DELETE
     NNETJDEL() allows you to delete a job from a queue.  The job that is
     deleted is specified by its job number.  The job number has nothing to
     do with the logical position of a job within a queue.  The job number
     can be determined with NNETCAPJOB() or NNETJLIST().  A job that is
     already in process is canceled immediately by a call of NNETJDEL().

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  The user of a queue can delete a job only if the user
        submitted it to the queue.  The queue operator can remove any job.

 <B>Example</B>

     Delete the second job from the queue LINEPRINTER:

     nJob=BIN2I(SUBSTR(NNETJLIST('LINEPRINTER'),3,2))
     IF NNETJDEL('LINEPRINTER',nJob)
     ? 'Job has been deleted successfully!'
     ELSE
     ? 'Job could not be deleted!'
     ENDIF
