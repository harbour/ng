 <B>SET CONSOLE</B>
 Toggle console display to the screen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET CONSOLE ON | off | &lt;xlToggle&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>ON</B> displays the output of console commands on the screen.

     <B>OFF</B> suppresses the screen display of console commands.

     <B>&lt;xlToggle&gt;</B> is a logical expression that must be enclosed in
     parentheses.  A value of true (.T.) is the same as ON, and a value of
     false (.F.) is the same as OFF.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET CONSOLE determines whether or not console commands send output to
     the screen.  Console commands are commands that display to the screen
     without reference to row and column position.  In addition to sending
     output to the screen, console commands can simultaneously send output to
     the printer and/or a DOS text file.  Output is sent to the printer using
     the TO PRINTER clause common to many console commands, or with the SET
     PRINTER ON command.  Output is sent to a file using the TO FILE clause,
     SET ALTERNATE, or SET PRINTER TO.

     With CONSOLE ON, console commands display to the screen.  With CONSOLE
     OFF, the screen display of console commands is suppressed, but the
     echoing of output to either a file or the printer is unaffected.  This
     lets you send the output of console commands such as REPORT and LABEL
     FORM to the printer without the screen display--a common occurrence.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Keyboard input:</B> For console commands that accept input
        (including ACCEPT, INPUT, and WAIT), SET CONSOLE affects the display
        of the prompts as well as the input areas.  As a consequence, a SET
        CONSOLE OFF before one of these commands will not only prevent you
        from seeing what you type, but will also prevent the display of the
        message prompt.

     <B>.  Full-screen commands:</B> Full-screen commands such as @...SAY
        display to the screen independent of the current CONSOLE SETting.
        For this category of output commands, device control is performed
        using SET DEVICE to control whether output goes to the screen or
        printer, and SET PRINTER TO echo output to a file.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example uses REPORT FORM to output records to the printer
        while suppressing output to the screen:

        USE Sales NEW
        SET CONSOLE OFF
        REPORT FORM Sales TO PRINTER

        SET CONSOLE ON
