        Button.ch contains manifest constants for the RadioGroup:hitTest()
        return value.

        hitTest() is a method of the RadioGroup class that is used for
        determining if the mouse cursor is within the region of the screen
        that any of the RadioButto objects contained within the radio group
        occupies.  hitTest() accomplishes this by calling the hitTest()
        method of each of the radio buttons in its group.
