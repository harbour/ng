 <B>SKIP</B>
 Move the record pointer to a new position
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SKIP [&lt;nRecords&gt;] [ALIAS &lt;idAlias&gt; | &lt;nWorkArea&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nRecords&gt;</B> is a numeric expression specifying the number of records
     to move the record pointer from the current position.  A positive value
     moves the record pointer forward and a negative value moves the record
     pointer backward.

     <B>ALIAS &lt;idAlias&gt;|&lt;nWorkArea&gt;</B> specifies the alias name as a literal
     identifier or the work area as a numeric expression.

     SKIP specified with no arguments moves the record pointer forward one
     record.

 <B>Description</B>

     SKIP moves the record pointer to a new position relative to the current
     position in the current work area and within the current filter, if
     there is one.  SKIP is generally used for operations, such as reporting,
     that need to go to the next record in a database file.

     If the alias clause is specified, the pointer can be moved in another
     work area without SELECTing that work area.  SKIP can move either
     forward or backward.  If there is no active index, SKIP moves the record
     pointer relative to the current position in the target database file.
     If there is an active index, SKIP moves the pointer relative to the
     current position in the index instead of the database file.

     Attempting to SKIP forward beyond the end of file positions the record
     pointer at LASTREC() + 1, and EOF() returns true (.T.).  Attempting to
     SKIP backward beyond the beginning of file moves the pointer to the
     first record, and BOF() returns true (.T.).

     In a network environment, any record movement command, including SKIP,
     makes changes to the current work area visible to other applications if
     the current file is shared and the changes were made during an RLOCK().
     To force an update to become visible without changing the current record
     position, use SKIP 0.  If, however, the changes were made during an
     FLOCK(), visibility is not guaranteed until the lock is released, a
     COMMIT is performed, or the file is closed.  Refer to the "Network
     Programming" chapter in the Programming and Utilities Guide for more
     information.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example uses SKIP with various arguments and shows their
        results:

        USE Customers NEW
        SKIP
        ? RECNO()                  // Result: 2
        SKIP 10
        ? RECNO()                  // Result: 12
        SKIP -5
        ? RECNO()                  // Result: 7

     <B>.</B>  This example moves the record pointer in a remote work area:

        USE Customers NEW
        USE Invoices NEW
        SKIP ALIAS Customers

     <B>.</B>  This example prints a report using SKIP to move the record
        pointer sequentially through the Customer database file:

        LOCAL nLine := 99
        USE Customers NEW
        SET PRINTER ON
        DO WHILE !EOF()
           IF nLine &gt; 55
              EJECT
              nLine := 1
           ENDIF
              ? Customer, Address, City, State, Zip
              nLine++
              SKIP
           ENDDO
        SET PRINTER OFF
        CLOSE Customers
