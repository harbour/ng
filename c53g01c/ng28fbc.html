 <B>DBINFO()</B>
 Return and optionally change information about a database file opened in a
 work area
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBINFO(&lt;nInfoType&gt;, [&lt;expNewSetting&gt;])</B>
     <B>   --&gt; uCurrentSetting</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nInfoType&gt;</B> determines the type of information, as specified by the
     constants below.  Note, however, that not all constants are supported
     for all RDDs.  These constants are defined in the Dbinfo.ch header file,
     which must be included (#include) in your application.

     <B>File Information Type Constants</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Constant                 Description</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DBI_ALIAS                Alias name of the work area as a string.
     DBI_BLOB_DIRECT_LEN      Returns the storage length of a data item in a
                              BLOB file.  &lt;expNewSetting&gt; must specify a
                              valid BLOB pointer obtained from
                              DbFieldInfo(DBS_BLOB_POINTER, &lt;nFieldpos&gt;),
                              BLOBDirectPut() or BLOBDirectImport().
     DBI_BLOB_DIRECT_TYPE     Returns the data type of a data item in a BLOB
                              file. &lt;expNewSetting&gt; must specify a valid BLOB
                              pointer obtained from
                              DbFieldInfo (DBS_BLOB_POINTER, &lt;nFieldpos&gt;),
                              BLOBDirectPut(), or BLOBDirectImport().
     DBI_BLOB_INTEGRITY       Tests a BLOB file for the integrity of its
                              internal tables and returns a logical value
                              indicating the success, true (.T.) or failure,
                              false (.F.) of the integrity check.  If the
                              integrity check fails, you can run
                              dbInfo(DBI_BLOB_RECOVER) which will
                              automatically correct the BLOB file's tables.
                              Checking a BLOB file's integrity is a disk
                              intensive operation and should only be
                              performed when the file's integrity is in
                              question.
     DBI_BLOB_OFFSET          Returns the file offset of a data item in a
                              BLOB file. &lt;expNewSetting&gt; must specify a valid
                              BLOB pointer obtained from
                              DbFieldInfo(DBS_BLOB_POINTER, &lt;nFieldpos&gt;),
                              BLOBDirectPut(), or BLOBDirectImport().
     DBI_BLOB_RECOVER         Recovers a damaged BLOB file by correcting its
                              internal tables. You should run this function
                              only is dbInfo(DBI_BLOB_INTEGRITY) returns
                              false (.F.). Note that this function can only
                              correct the BLOB file's internal tables, it
                              cannot restore any data that may have become
                              corrupted.

     <B>Important! </B> DBI_USER is a constant that returns the minimum value
     that third-party RDD developers can use for defining new &lt;nInfoType&gt;
     parameters.  Values less than DBI_USER are reserved for Computer
     Associates development.

     <B>&lt;expNewSetting&gt;</B> is reserved for RDDs that allow the file information
     to be changed, in addition to being retrieved.  None of the RDDs
     supplied with CA-Clipper support this argument.  It can be omitted or
     specified as NIL.

 <B>Returns</B>

     DBINFO() returns the current setting if &lt;expNewSetting&gt; is not
     specified, .  If &lt;expNewSetting&gt; is specified, the previous setting is
     returned.

 <B>Description</B>

     DBINFO() retrieves information about a database file.  By default, this
     function operates on the currently selected work area.  It can be made
     to operate on an unselected work area by specifying it within an aliased
     expression.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  The following examples return work area information:

        #include Dbinfo.ch

        ? DBINFO(DBI_GETHEADERSIZE)         // Same as HEADER()
        ? DBINFO(DBI_LASTUPDATE)            // Same as LUPDATE()
        ? DBINFO(DBI_GETRECSIZE)            // Same as RECSIZE()
        ? DBINFO(DBI_FILEHANDLE)            // DOS file handle for
                                            // the current database
                                            // file

 <B>Files</B>   Library is CLIPPER.LIB, header file is Dbinfo.ch.
