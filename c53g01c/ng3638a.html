 <B>DELETED()</B>
 Return the deleted status of the current record
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DELETED() --&gt; lDeleted</B>

 <B>Returns</B>

     DELETED() returns true (.T.) if the current record is marked for
     deletion; otherwise, it returns false (.F.).  If there is no database
     file in USE in the current work area, DELETED() returns false (.F.).

 <B>Description</B>

     DELETED() is a database function that determines if the current record
     in the active work area is marked for deletion.  Since each work area
     with an open database file can have a current record, each work area has
     its own DELETED() value.

     By default, DELETED() operates on the currently selected work area.  It
     will operate on an unselected work area if you specify it as part of an
     aliased expression (see example below).

     In applications, DELETED() is generally used to query the deleted status
     as a part of record processing conditions, or to display the deleted
     status as a part of screens and reports.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example uses DELETED() in the current and in an
        unselected work area:

        USE Customer NEW
        USE Sales NEW
        ? DELETED()                     // Result: .F.
        DELETE
        ? DELETED()                     // Result: .T.
        ? Customer-&gt;(DELETED())         // Result: .F.

     <B>.</B>  This example uses DELETED() to display a record's deleted
        status in screens and reports:

        @ 1, 65 SAY IF(DELETED(), "Inactive", "Active")
