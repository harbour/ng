     <B>caption                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a character string that describes the push button on the
        screen.

        When present, the <B>&amp;</B> character specifies that the character
        immediately following it in the caption is the push button's
        accelerator key. The accelerator key provides a quick and convenient
        mechanism for the user to move input focus from one data input
        control to a push button.  The user performs the selection by
        pressing the Alt key in combination with an accelerator key.  The
        case of an accelerator key is ignored.
