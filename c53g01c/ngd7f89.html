 <B>RENAME</B>
 Change the name of a file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>RENAME &lt;xcOldFile&gt; TO &lt;xcNewFile&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;xcOldFile&gt;</B> is the name of the file to be renamed including an
     extension, and optionally is preceded by a drive and/or path designator.
     &lt;xcOldFile&gt; can be a literal string or a character expression enclosed
     in parentheses.

     <B>TO &lt;xcNewFile&gt;</B> specifies the new file name including extension and
     optionally prefaced by a drive and/or path designator.  &lt;xcNewFile&gt; can
     be a literal string or a character expression enclosed in parentheses.

 <B>Description</B>

     RENAME is a file command that changes the name of a specified file to a
     new name.  If the source directory is different from the target
     directory, the file moves to the new directory.  RENAME does not use SET
     DEFAULT and SET PATH to locate &lt;xcOldFile&gt;.  Instead, the &lt;xcOldFile&gt; is
     renamed only if it is located in the current DOS directory or in the
     specified path.

     In the instance that either &lt;xcNewFile&gt; exists or is currently open,
     RENAME does nothing.  To trap this condition as an error, use the FILE()
     function before executing the command.  See the example.

     <B>Warning! </B> Files must be CLOSEd before renaming.  Attempting to
     rename an open file will produce unpredictable results.  When a database
     file is RENAMEd, remember that any associated memo (.dbt) file must also
     be RENAMEd.  Failure to do so may compromise the integrity of your
     program.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example renames a file, checking for the existence of the
        target file before beginning the RENAME operation:

        xcOldFile := "OldFile.txt"
        xcNewFile := "NewFile.txt"
        IF !FILE(xcNewFile)
           RENAME (xcOldFile) TO (xcNewFile)
           ELSE
        ? "File already exists"
        ENDIF
