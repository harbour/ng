     <B>PopUp([&lt;nTop&gt;], [&lt;nLeft&gt;], [&lt;nBottom&gt;], [&lt;nRight&gt;])</B>
     <B>   --&gt; oPopUp</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nTop&gt;</B> is a numeric value that indicates the top screen row of the
     pop-up menu.  If omitted, PopUpMenu:top is set to an appropriate value
     relative to &lt;nBottom&gt; that allows as many items as possible to show.  If
     &lt;nBottom&gt; is also omitted, PopUpMenu:top is set to center the menu
     vertically on the screen.  The default value is determined the first
     time the pop-up menu is displayed.

     When the pop-up menu is a child of another menu, its top variable will
     be automatically set by the parent menu regardless of whether &lt;nTop&gt; is
     omitted.

     <B>&lt;nLeft&gt;</B> is a numeric value that indicates the left screen column of
     the pop-up menu.  If omitted, PopUpMenu:left is set to an appropriate
     value relative to &lt;nRight&gt; that allows as many menu columns as possible
     to show.  If &lt;nRight&gt; is also omitted, PopUpMenu:left is set to center
     the menu horizontally on the screen.  The default value is determined
     the first time the pop-up menu is displayed.

     When the pop-up menu is a child of another menu, its left variable will
     be automatically set by the parent menu regardless of whether &lt;nLeft&gt; is
     omitted.

     <B>&lt;nBottom&gt;</B> is a numeric value that indicates the bottom screen row of
     the pop-up menu.  If omitted, PopUpMenu:bottom is set to an appropriate
     value relative to &lt;nTop&gt; that allows as many items as possible to show.
     If &lt;nTop&gt; is also omitted, PopUpMenu:bottom is set to center the menu
     vertically on the screen.  The default value is determined the first
     time the pop-up menu is displayed.

     When the pop-up menu is a child of another menu, its bottom variable
     will be automatically set by the parent menu regardless of whether
     &lt;nBottom&gt; is omitted.

     <B>&lt;nRight&gt;</B> is a numeric value that indicates the right screen column
     of the pop-up menu.  If omitted, PopUpMenu:right is set to an
     appropriate value relative to &lt;nLeft&gt; that allows as many menu columns
     as possible to show.  If &lt;nLeft&gt; is also omitted, PopUpMenu:right is set
     to center the menu horizontally on the screen.  The default value is
     determined the first time the pop-up menu is displayed.

     When the pop-up menu is a child of another menu, its right variable will
     be automatically set by the parent menu regardless of whether &lt;nRight&gt;
     is omitted.
