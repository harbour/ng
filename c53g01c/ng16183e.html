     <B>setstyle(&lt;nStyle&gt;, [&lt;lSetting&gt;]) --&gt; self</B>

        TBrowse:setStyle() maintains a dictionary within a TBrowse object.
        This dictionary, which is simply an array, contains a set of logical
        values that determine behaviors associated with a TBrowse object.
        &lt;nStyle&gt; refers to the element in the dictionary that contains the
        style.  &lt;lSetting&gt; indicates whether the style should be permitted or
        denied.  Set to true (.T.) to allow the behavior to occur; otherwise,
        set to false (.F.) to prohibit it.  CA-Clipper reserves the first
        four elements of the dictionary for predefined styles.

        You may add custom styles to a TBrowse object by specifying any
        unused element of the dictionary.  A maximum of 4096 definitions is
        available.  When adding new styles to the dictionary, use the
        TBR_CUSTOM constant to ensure that the new styles will not interfere
        with the predefined ones.  This guarantees that if more predefined
        styles are added in future releases of CA-Clipper, the positions of
        your styles in the dictionary will be adjusted automatically.

        Styles are not utilized by the TBrowse object.  The style dictionary
        is merely a convenient method of associating behaviors with a browse.
        The functions that query and implement these behaviors are external
        to the object.  An example of this can be found in BrowSys.prg in the
        clip53\samples subdirectory.

        <B>Number  TBrowse.ch     Meaning</B>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        1       TBR_APPEND     Can the user add new information?
        2       TBR_MODIFY     Can the user modify the data in the browse's
                               cells?
        3       TBR_MOVE       Can the user move the column to another
                               position in the browse?
        4       TBR_SIZE       Can the user modify the width of the column?
        5       TBR_CUSTOM     First available element for custom styles.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Tbrowse.ch contains manifest constants for TBrowse:setStyle().

        <B>Note: </B> TBR_MOVE and TBR_SIZE are not implemented in CA-Clipper
        5.3.  They are reserved for future usage.
