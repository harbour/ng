 <B>BOF()</B>
 Determine when beginning of file is encountered
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>BOF() --&gt; lBoundary</B>

 <B>Returns</B>

     BOF() returns true (.T.) after an attempt to SKIP backward beyond the
     first logical record in a database file; otherwise, it returns false
     (.F.).  If there is no database file open in the current work area,
     BOF() returns false (.F.).  If the current database file contains no
     records, BOF() returns true (.T.).

 <B>Description</B>

     BOF() is a database function used to test for a boundary condition when
     you are moving the record pointer backward through a database file using
     the SKIP command.  A simple usage example is a descending order record
     list with an ascending order index file.  A more sophisticated example
     is a screen paging routine that pages forward or backward through the
     current database file based on the key the user presses.  When the user
     attempts to page backward, you would use BOF() to test for a beginning
     of file condition before using the SKIP command to move the record
     pointer and repaint the screen.

     Once BOF() is set to true (.T.), it retains its value until there is
     another attempt to move the record pointer.

     By default, BOF() operates on the currently selected work area.  It can
     be made to operate on an unselected work area by specifying it within an
     aliased expression (see example below).

     The SKIP command is the only record movement command that can set BOF()
     to true (.T.).

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates BOF() by attempting to move the
        record pointer before the first record:

        USE Sales NEW
        ? RECNO(), BOF()               // Result: 1 .F.
        SKIP -1
        ? RECNO(), BOF()               // Result: 1 .T.

     <B>.</B>  This example uses aliased expressions to query the value of
        BOF() in unselected work areas:

        USE Sales NEW
        USE Customer NEW
        USE Invoices NEW

        ? Sales-&gt;(BOF()), Customer-&gt;(BOF())
