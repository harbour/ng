 <B>RELEASE</B>
 Delete public and private memory variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>RELEASE &lt;idMemvar list&gt;</B>
     <B>RELEASE ALL [LIKE | EXCEPT &lt;skeleton&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;idMemvar list&gt;</B> is a list of private or public variables or arrays
     to delete.

     <B>ALL [LIKE|EXCEPT &lt;skeleton&gt;]</B> defines the set of visible private
     memory variables to assign, or to exclude from assignment of, a NIL
     value.  &lt;skeleton&gt; is the wildcard mask to specify a group of memory
     variables to delete.  The wildcard characters supported are * and ?.

 <B>Description</B>

     RELEASE is a memory variable command that performs one of two actions
     depending on how it is specified.  If RELEASE is specified with
     &lt;idMemvar list&gt;, the specified public and private memory variables
     and/or arrays are deleted from memory.  Previous hidden instances
     (public or private variables defined in higher-level procedures) become
     accessible upon termination of the procedure where the variable was
     originally created.

     If RELEASE is specified with any form of the ALL clause, private memory
     variables created at the current procedure level are assigned a NIL and
     not deleted until the current procedure or user-defined function
     terminates.  Public variables are unaffected by this form of the RELEASE
     command.  To release public variables, you must RELEASE them explicitly
     or use CLEAR MEMORY.

     Local or static variables are not affected by the RELEASE command.
     Local variables are released automatically when the procedure or user-
     defined function (where the variables were declared) terminates.  Static
     variables cannot be released since they exist for the duration of the
     program.
