     <B>&lt;oListBox&gt;:select(&lt;nPosition&gt;) --&gt; self</B>

        <B>&lt;nPosition&gt;</B> is a numeric value that indicates the position in the
        list of the item to select.

        select() is a method of the ListBox class that is used for changing
        the selected item in a list.  Its state is typically changed when one
        of the arrow keys is pressed or the mouse's left button is pressed
        when its cursor is within the ListBox object's screen region.  If
        necessary, select() will call its display() method to ensure that the
        newly selected item is visible.

        <B>Note: </B> When present, the scroll bar is automatically updated to
        reflect the new first visible item in the list when the call to
        ListBox:select() causes the list to be scrolled.
