 <B>DBSKIP()</B>
 Move relative to the current record
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBSKIP([&lt;nRecords&gt;]) --&gt; NIL</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nRecords&gt;</B> is the number of logical records to move, relative to the
     current record.  A positive value means to skip forward, and a negative
     value means to skip backward.  If &lt;nRecords&gt; is omitted, a value of 1 is
     assumed.

 <B>Returns</B>

     DBSKIP() always returns NIL.

 <B>Description</B>

     DBSKIP() moves either forward or backward relative to the current
     record.  Attempting to skip forward beyond the last record positions the
     work area to LASTREC() + 1 and EOF() returns true (.T.).  Attempting to
     skip backward beyond the first record positions the work area to the
     first record and BOF() returns true (.T.).

     DBSKIP() performs the same function as the standard SKIP command.  For
     more information, refer to the SKIP command.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Logical records:</B> DBSKIP() operates on logical records.  If
        there is an active index, records are considered in indexed order.
        If a filter is set, only records which meet the filter condition are
        considered.

     <B>.  Controlling order:</B> If the work area has more than one active
        index, the skip operation is performed using the controlling order as
        set by DBSETORDER() or the SET ORDER command.  For more information,
        refer to the SET ORDER command.

     <B>.  Network environment:</B> For a shared file on a network, moving to
        a different record may cause updates to the current record to become
        visible to other processes.  For more information, refer to the
        "Network Programming" chapter in the Programming and Utilities Guide.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates a typical use of the DBSKIP()
        function:

        DBGOTOP()

        DO WHILE ( !EOF() )
           ? FIELD-&gt;Name
           DBSKIP()
        ENDDO
