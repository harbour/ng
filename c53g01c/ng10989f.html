 <B>PRIVATE</B>
 Create and initialize private memory variables and arrays
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>PRIVATE &lt;identifier&gt; [[:= &lt;initializer&gt;], ... ]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;identifier&gt;</B> is the name of a private variable or array to create.
     If the &lt;identifier&gt; is followed by square brackets ([ ]), an array is
     created and assigned to the &lt;identifier&gt;.  When the &lt;identifier&gt;
     specification indicates an array, the syntax for specifying the number
     of elements for each dimension can be array[&lt;nElements&gt;,
     &lt;nElements2&gt;,...] or array[&lt;nElements&gt;][&lt;nElements2&gt;]...  The maximum
     number of elements per dimension is 4096.  The maximum number of
     dimensions is limited only by available memory.

     <B>&lt;initializer&gt;</B> is the optional assignment of a value to a new private
     variable.  An array cannot be given values with an &lt;initializer&gt;.  An
     &lt;initializer&gt; for a private variable consists of the inline assignment
     operator (:=) followed by any valid CA-Clipper expression including a
     literal array.  If no explicit &lt;initializer&gt; is specified, the variable
     is initialized to NIL.  In the case of an array, each element is
     initialized to NIL.

     You can create and, optionally, initialize a list of variables and
     arrays with one PRIVATE statement if the definitions are separated by
     commas.

 <B>Description</B>

     The PRIVATE statement creates variables and arrays visible within the
     current and invoked procedures or user-defined functions.  This class of
     variable is said to have dynamic scope.  Private variables exist for the
     duration of the active procedure or until explicitly released with CLEAR
     ALL, CLEAR MEMORY, or RELEASE.  When a private variable or array is
     created, existing and visible private and public variables of the same
     name are hidden until the current procedure or user-defined function
     terminates.

     Attempting to specify a PRIVATE variable that conflicts with a previous
     FIELD, LOCAL, or STATIC declaration of the same name results in a fatal
     compiler error.  This is true regardless of the scope of the
     declaration.

     PRIVATE statements are executable statements and, therefore, must be
     specified within the body of a procedure or user-defined function and
     must follow all variable declarations, such as FIELD, LOCAL, MEMVAR, and
     STATIC.

     In addition to the PRIVATE statement, private variables are also created
     in two other ways:

     <B>.</B>  Assignment to a variable that does not exist or is not visible
        will create a private variable

     <B>.</B>  Parameters received using the PARAMETERS statement are created
        as private variables with the same lifetime and visibility

     No more than 2048 private and public variables and arrays can
     simultaneously exist in a single program.

     For more information on variable declarations and scoping, refer to the
     Variables section in the "Basic Concepts" chapter of the Programming and
     Utilities Guide.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Compatibility: </B> The ALL, LIKE, and EXCEPT clauses of the
        PRIVATE statement supported by other dBASE dialects are not supported
        by CA-Clipper.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example creates two PRIVATE arrays and three other
        PRIVATE variables:

        PRIVATE aArray1[10], aArray2[20], var1, var2, var3

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a multidimensional private array using
        each element addressing convention:

        PRIVATE aArray[10][10][10], aArray2[10, 10, 10]

     <B>.</B>  This example uses PRIVATE statements to create and initialize
        arrays and variables:

        PRIVATE aArray := { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, ;
              aArray2 := ARRAY(12, 24)
        PRIVATE cChar := SPACE(10), cColor := SETCOLOR()
