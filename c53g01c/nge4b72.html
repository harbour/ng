 <B>SET DESCENDING</B>
 Change the descending flag of the controlling order
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET DESCENDING ON | OFF | (&lt;lToggle&gt;)</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>ON</B> enables the descending flag.

     <B>OFF</B> disables the descending flag.

     <B>&lt;lToggle&gt;</B> is a logical expression that must be enclosed in
     parentheses.  A value of true (.T.) is the same as ON, and a value of
     false (.F.) is the same as OFF.

     <B>Note: </B> The initial default of this setting depends on whether the
     controlling order was created with DESCENDING as an attribute.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET DESCENDING is functionally equivalent to ORDDESCEND().  Refer to
     this function for more information.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  The following example illustrates SET DESCENDING.  every order
        can be both ascending and descending:

        USE Customer VIA "DBFCDX"
        INDEX ON LastName TAG Last
        INDEX ON FirstName TAG First DESCENDING

        SET ORDER TO TAG Last
        // last was originally created in ascending order

        // Swap it to descending
        SET DESCENDING ON
        // Last will now be processed in descending order

        SET ORDER TO TAG First
        // First was originally created in descending order


        // Swap it to ascending
        SET DESCENDING OFF
        // First will now be processed in ascending order
