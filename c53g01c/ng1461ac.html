     <B>&lt;oPopUp&gt;:close([&lt;lCloseChild&gt;]) --&gt; self</B>

        &lt;lCloseChild&gt; is a logical value that indicates whether
        PopUpMenu:close() should deactivate the pop-up menu in its selected
        item, which in turn deactivates the pop-up menu in its selected item
        and so on.  This is useful for nested menus where multiple levels of
        choices are presented.  A value of true (.T.) indicates that child
        pop-up menu items should be closed.  A value of false (.F.) indicates
        that child pop-up menu items should not be closed.  The default value
        is true.

        close() is a method of the PopUpMenu class that is used for
        deactivating a pop-up menu.  When called, PopUpMenu:close() performs
        three operations.  First, if the value of &lt;lCloseChild&gt; is not false
        (.F.) , close() determines if its selected menu item contains a
        PopUpMenu object.  If so, it calls its selected menu item's close()
        method.  Second, close() restores the previous contents of the region
        of the screen that it occupies.  Third, close() sets its selected
        item to 0.

        <B>Note: </B> This message only has meaning when the pop-up menu is
        open.
