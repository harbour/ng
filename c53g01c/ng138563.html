     <B>minus                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a logical value indicating that a minus sign (-) has been
        added to the editing buffer.  Get:minus is set to true (.T.) only
        when the Get object is a numeric type, the current value of the
        editing buffer is zero and the last change to the editing buffer was
        the addition of the minus sign.  It is cleared when any change is
        made to the buffer.
