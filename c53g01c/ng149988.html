     <B>bitmap                                        (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a character string that indicates a bitmap file to be
        displayed on the button.  Drive and directory names are not allowed;
        the file name extension is required.  A bitmap file can be stored as
        a file on disk or in a bitmap library.  If stored as a file, the file
        must reside in the same directory as the application.  If stored in a
        bitmap library, the library must reside in the same directory as the
        application and it also must have the same name as the application
        with a .BML extension.

        CA-Clipper will search for the file name first and, if it is not
        found, search in the bitmap library second.  If no file is found
        either on disk or in the library, no bitmap will be displayed.  This
        instance variable only affects applications running in graphic mode
        and is ignored in text mode.
