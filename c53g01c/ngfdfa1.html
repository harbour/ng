 <B>DO*</B>
 Call a procedure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DO &lt;idProcedure&gt; [WITH &lt;argument list&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;idProcedure&gt;</B> is the name of the procedure or user-defined function
     to be executed.

     <B>WITH &lt;argument list&gt;</B> specifies up to 128 arguments, separated by
     commas, to pass to &lt;idProcedure&gt;.  Each argument may be a single
     variable, field, array, array element, expression, or object.  Arguments
     can be skipped or left off the end of the list.

 <B>Description</B>

     The DO statement calls a procedure or user-defined function, optionally
     passing arguments to the called routine.  It performs the same action as
     a user-defined function or procedure specified on a line by itself with
     the exception that variables other than field variables are passed by
     reference as the default.  In order to pass a field variable as an
     argument, enclose it in parentheses, unless you declare it with the
     FIELD statement or with an alias.

     In CA-Clipper, the number of specified arguments need not match the
     number of specified parameters in the called procedure.  If the number
     of arguments is less than the number of parameters, the parameter
     variables with no corresponding arguments are initialized with a NIL
     value when the procedure is called.  If the number of arguments is
     greater than the number of parameters, they are ignored.

     Also, skipping an argument within the &lt;argument list&gt; by leaving an
     empty spot next to the comma initializes the corresponding argument to
     NIL.  To detect the position of the last argument passed in the
     &lt;argument list&gt;, use PCOUNT().  To detect a skipped argument, compare
     the receiving parameter to NIL.

     In addition to calling a procedure or user-defined function, DO also has
     an effect on compilation if you compile the current program file without
     the /M option.  If the CA-Clipper compiler encounters a DO statement and
     the specified procedure has not already been compiled, the compiler
     searches the current directory for a .prg file with the same name and
     compiles it.  If the file with the same name as the procedure is not
     found, the called procedure is assumed to be external, and a reference
     is added to the object (.OBJ) file.  At link time, the linker will
     search other object files and libraries for this external reference.

     In CA-Clipper, DO is a compatibility statement and therefore not
     recommended.  Calling a procedure or function on a line by itself is the
     preferred method.  Since this preferred calling convention normally
     passes parameters by value, you must preface an argument with the pass-
     by-reference operator (@) in order to pass by reference.  If you are
     using DO to make a procedure call more readable, a user-defined command,
     specified with the #command directive, can provide greater readability
     without sacrificing the safety of variables passed as parameters.

     For more information on passing parameters refer to the Functions and
     Procedures section of the "Basic Concepts" chapter in the Programming
     and Utilities Guide.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example executes a procedure with no parameters:

        DO AcctsRpt
        AcctsRpt()                           // Preferred method

     <B>.</B>  This example executes a procedure passing two constants:

        DO QtrRpt WITH "2nd", "Sales Division"
        QtrRpt("2nd", "Sales Division")      // Preferred method

     <B>.</B>  In this example, a procedure is executed with the first
        argument passed by value and the second passed by reference:

        nNumber := 12
        DO YearRpt WITH nNumber + 12, nNumber
        YearRpt(nNumber + 12, @nNumber)      // Preferred method

     <B>.</B>  Here, a procedure is invoked with skipped arguments embedded
        in the list of arguments:

        DO DisplayWindow WITH ,,,,"My Window"
        DisplayWindow(,,,,"My Window")       // Preferred method
