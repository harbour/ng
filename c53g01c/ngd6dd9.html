 <B>REINDEX</B>
 Rebuild open indexes in the current work area
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>REINDEX</B>
     <B>   [EVAL &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [EVERY &lt;nRecords&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>EVAL &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies a condition that is evaluated either for
     each record processed or at the interval specified by the EVERY clause.
     This clause is identical to the EVAL clause of the INDEX command, but
     must be respecified in order for the reindexing operation to be
     monitored since the value of &lt;lCondition&gt; is transient.

     <B>EVERY &lt;nRecords&gt;</B> specifies a numeric expression that modifies how
     often EVAL is evaluated.  When using EVAL, the EVERY option offers a
     performance enhancement by evaluating the condition for every nth record
     instead of evaluating each record reindexed.  The EVERY keyword is
     ignored if no EVAL condition is specified.

 <B>Description</B>

     REINDEX is a database command that rebuilds all open indexes in the
     current work area.  When the reindexing operation finishes, all rebuilt
     indexes remain open, order is reset to one, and the record pointer is
     positioned to the first record in the controlling index.  If any of the
     indexes were created with SET UNIQUE ON, REINDEX adds only unique keys
     to the index.  If any of the indexes were created using a FOR condition,
     only those key values from records matching the condition are added to
     the index.

     In a network environment, REINDEX requires EXCLUSIVE USE of the current
     database file.  Refer to the "Network Programming" chapter in the
     Programming and Utilities Guide for more information.

     <B>Caution! </B> REINDEX does not recreate the header of the index file
     when it recreates the index.  Because of this, REINDEX does not help if
     there is corruption of the file header.  To guarantee a valid index,
     always use INDEX ON in place of REINDEX to rebuild damaged indexes

 <B>Notes</B>

     Index key order, UNIQUE status, and the FOR condition are known to the
     index (.ntx) file and are, therefore, respected and maintained by
     REINDEX.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example REINDEXes the index open in the current work
        area:

        USE Sales INDEX Salesman, Territory NEW
        REINDEX

     <B>.</B>  This example REINDEXes using a progress indicator:

     USE Sales INDEX Salesman, Territory NEW
        REINDEX EVAL NtxProgress() EVERY 10

        FUNCTION NtxProgress
        LOCAL cComplete := LTRIM(STR((RECNO()/LASTREC()) * 100))
        @ 23, 00 SAY "Indexing..." + cComplete + "%"

        RETURN .T.
