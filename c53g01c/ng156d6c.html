        character is the client area character.  Its default value is the
        character.  The third is the thumb character.  Its default is the
        character.  The fourth character is the next arrow character.  Its
        default value is the down arrow character for a vertically
        oriented scroll bar or the right arrow character for a
        horizontally oriented scroll bar.
