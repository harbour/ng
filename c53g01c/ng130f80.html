     <B>caption                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an optional character string that concisely describes the
        check box on the screen.  If omitted, the default is an empty string.

        When present, the <B>&amp;</B> character specifies that the character
        immediately following it in the caption is the check box's
        accelerator key. The accelerator key provides a quick and convenient
        mechanism for the user to move input focus from one data input
        control to the check box.  The user performs the selection by
        pressing the Alt key in combination with an accelerator key.  The
        case of an accelerator key is ignored.
