     <B>style                                         (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a character string that indicates the delimiter characters
        that are used by the push button's display() method.  The string must
        contain either zero, two or eight characters.  The default is two
        characters.  The first is the left delimiter.  Its default value is
        the less than (&lt;) character.  The second character is the right
        delimiter.  Its default value is the greater than (&gt;) character.

        When the string is empty the button has no delimiters.

        When the string length is two, the button has left and right
        delimiters and occupies one row on the screen.  The first character
        is the left delimiter.  The second character is the right delimiter.

        When the string length is eight, the button is contained within a box
        that occupies three rows on the screen.  A PushButton object may only
        be either one or three lines in height.
