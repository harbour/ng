     <B>setstyle(&lt;nStyle&gt;, [&lt;lSetting&gt;]) --&gt; self</B>

        TBColumn:setStyle() maintains a dictionary within a TBColumn object.
        This dictionary, which is simply an array, contains a set of logical
        values that determine behaviors associated with a TBrowse column.
        &lt;nStyle&gt; refers to the element in the dictionary that contains the
        style.  &lt;lSetting&gt; indicates whether the style should be permitted or
        denied.  Set to true (.T.) to allow the behavior to occur; otherwise,
        set to false (.F.) to prohibit it.  CA-Clipper reserves the first
        three elements of the dictionary for predefined styles.

        You may add custom styles to a TBColumn object by specifying any
        unused element of the dictionary.  A maximum of 4096 definitions is
        available.  When adding new styles to the dictionary, use the
        TBC_CUSTOM constant to ensure that the new styles will not interfere
        with the predefined ones.  This guarantees that if more predefined
        styles are added in future releases of CA-Clipper, the positions of
        your styles in the dictionary will be adjusted automatically.

        Styles are used by neither the TBColumn object nor the TBrowse
        object.  The style dictionary is merely a convenient method of
        associating behaviors with a TBColumn object. The functions that
        query and implement these behaviors are external to the object.  An
        example of this can be found in BrowSys.prg in the clip53\samples
        subdirectory.

        <B>TBColumn Styles</B>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        <B>Number  TBrowse.ch     Meaning</B>
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        1       TBC_READWRITE  Can the user modify the data in the column's
                               cells?
        2       TBC_MOVE       Can the user move the column to another
                               position in the browse?
        3       TBC_SIZE       Can the user modify the width of the column?
        4       TBC_CUSTOM     First available element for custom styles.
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Tbrowse.ch contains manifest constants for TBColumn:SetStyle().

     <B>Note: </B> TBC_MOVE and TBC_SIZE are not implemented in CA-Clipper 5.3.
     They are reserved for future usage.
