 <B>CLEAR ALL*</B>
 Close files and release public and private variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CLEAR ALL</B>

 <B>Description</B>

     CLEAR ALL releases all public and private variables, closes all open
     databases and related files in all active work areas, and SELECTs work
     area 1.  Related files are index, alternate, and memo files.  CLEAR ALL,
     however, does not release local or static variables.

     CLEAR ALL is a compatibility command and therefore not recommended.  Its
     usage in CA-Clipper is superseded by the command or function that
     performs the specific action you need.  You can close files associated
     with work areas with one of the various forms of the CLOSE command.  You
     can release private and public variables using the RELEASE command
     although explicitly releasing variables is discouraged in most
     instances.  For more information on the scope and lifetime of variables,
     refer to the "Basic Concepts" chapter in the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
