 <B>LABEL FORM</B>
 Display labels to the console
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>LABEL FORM &lt;xcLabel&gt;</B>
     <B>   [TO PRINTER] [TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;] [NOCONSOLE]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;] [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [SAMPLE]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;xcLabel&gt;</B> is the name of the label (.lbl) file that contains the
     FORM definition of the LABEL and can be specified either as a literal
     file name or as a character expression enclosed in parentheses.  If an
     extension is not specified .lbl is assumed.

     <B>TO PRINTER</B> echoes output to the printer.

     <B>TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;</B> echoes output to &lt;xcFile&gt;.  Specify &lt;xcFile&gt; as a
     literal file name or as a character expression enclosed in parentheses.
     If an extension is not specified, .txt is added.

     <B>NOCONSOLE</B> suppresses all LABEL FORM output to the console.  If not
     specified, output automatically displays to the console unless SET
     CONSOLE is OFF.

     <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to display
     labels.  The default is ALL records.

     <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the
     condition from the current record until the condition fails.

     <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies to LABEL FORM, the conditional set of
     records within the given scope.

     <B>SAMPLE</B> displays test labels as rows of asterisks.  Each test label
     has the same number of columns and rows as the label definition.  Then,
     following each test label display, is the query, "Do you want more
     samples?"  Answering "Y" forces another test label display.  Answering
     "N" causes LABEL FORM to display the actual labels for the specified
     scope and condition.

 <B>Description</B>

     LABEL FORM is a console command that sequentially accesses records in
     the current work area, displaying labels using a definition stored in a
     .lbl file.  Create the .lbl using RL.EXE or by dBASE III PLUS.  Refer to
     the "Report and Label Utility" chapter in the Programming and Utilities
     Guide for more information about creating label definitions.

     When invoked, output is sent to the screen and, optionally, to the
     printer and/or a file.  To suppress output to the screen while printing
     or echoing output to a file, SET CONSOLE OFF before invocation of LABEL
     FORM or use the NOCONSOLE keyword.

     When invoked, LABEL FORM searches the current SET PATH drive and
     directory, if the &lt;xcLabel&gt; file is not found in the current directory
     and the path is not specified.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Interrupting LABEL FORM:</B> To interrupt a LABEL FORM, use
        INKEY() as a part of the FOR condition to test for an interrupt key
        press.  See the example below.

     <B>.  Printer margin:</B> LABEL FORM obeys the current SET MARGIN for
        output echoed to the printer.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example prints a set of labels and writes them to a file
        with a single command.  Two forms of the command are shown:

        LOCAL cLabel := "Sales", cFile := "Sales"
        USE Sales INDEX Sales NEW
        LABEL FORM Sales TO PRINTER TO FILE Sales
        LABEL FORM (cLabel) TO PRINTER TO FILE (cFile)

     <B>.</B>  This example interrupts LABEL FORM using INKEY() to test if
        the user pressed the Esc key:

        #define K_ESC  27
        USE Sales INDEX Sales NEW
        LABEL FORM Sales WHILE INKEY() != K_ESC
