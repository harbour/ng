 <B>FRENAME()</B>
 Change the name of a file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>FRENAME(&lt;cOldFile&gt;, &lt;cNewFile&gt;) --&gt; nSuccess</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cOldFile&gt;</B> is the name of the file to be renamed, including the file
     extension.  A drive letter and/or path name may also be included as part
     of the file name.

     <B>&lt;cNewFile&gt;</B> is the new name of the file, including the file
     extension.  A drive letter and/or path name may also be included as part
     of the name.

 <B>Returns</B>

     FRENAME() returns -1 if the operation fails and zero if it succeeds.  In
     the case of a failure, FERROR() can be used to determine the nature of
     the error.

 <B>Description</B>

     FRENAME() is a file function that changes the name of a specified file
     to a new name and is identical to the RENAME command.

     When FRENAME() is called, &lt;cOldFile&gt; is renamed only if it is located in
     the current DOS directory or in the specified path.  FRENAME() does not
     use SET DEFAULT or SET PATH to locate &lt;cOldFile&gt;.

     If the source directory is different from the target directory, the file
     moves to the target directory.  In the instance that either &lt;cNewFile&gt;
     exists or is currently open, FRENAME() fails and returns -1, indicating
     that it did not perform its designated action.  The nature of the error
     can be determined with FERROR().

     <B>Warning! </B> Files must be CLOSEd before renaming.  Attempting to
     rename an open file will produce unpredictable results.  When a database
     file is renamed, the associated memo (.dbt) file must also be renamed.
     Failure to do so may compromise the integrity of your databases.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates a file rename:

        IF FRENAME("OldFile.txt", "NewFile.txt") == -1
           ? "File error:", FERROR()
        ENDIF
