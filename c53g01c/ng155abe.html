     <B>bitmaps                                 (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an array of exactly three elements.  The first element of
        this array is the file name of the bitmap to be displayed at the top
        of a vertical scroll bar or to the left of a horizontal scroll bar.
        The second element of this array is the file name of the bitmap to be
        displayed at the bottom of a vertical scroll bar or to the right of a
        horizontal scroll bar.  The third element of this array is the file
        name of the bitmap to be used as the thumbwheel.

        Drive and directory names are not allowed; the file name extension is
        required.  A bitmap file can be stored as a file on disk or in a
        bitmap library.  If stored as a file, the file must reside in the
        same directory as the application.  If stored in a bitmap library,
        the library must reside in the same directory as the application and
        it also must have the same name as the application with a .BML
        extension.

        CA-Clipper will search for the file name first and then, if it is not
        found, it will search in the bitmap library.  If no file is found
        either on disk or in the library, no bitmap will be displayed.

        If this instance variable is not used, and the application is running
        in graphic mode, the files ARROW_L.BMU, ARROW_R.BMU, and ARROW_E.BMU
        will be used for a horizontal scroll bar and the files ARROW_U.BMU,
        ARROW_D.BMU, and ARROW_E.BMU will be used for a horizontal scroll
        bar.

        This instance variable only affects applications running in graphic
        mode and is ignored in text mode.
