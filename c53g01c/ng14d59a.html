 Create a radio button
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Description</B>

     Radio buttons are typically presented in related groups and provide
     mutually exclusive responses to a condition where only one choice is
     appropriate.  For example, a group of radio buttons might allow you to
     sort public variables either by name or by address.

     Only one radio button can be on--when a new button is pressed, the
     previously selected button is turned off.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example creates two radio buttons, one with a caption of
        "Commands" and the other "Macros," and groups them together using the
        RadioGroup class:

        oRadio1:RadioButto(2,2,"Commands")
        oRadio2:RadioButto(3,2,"Macros")
        oRadiogroup:RadioGroup(2,2,3,9)
