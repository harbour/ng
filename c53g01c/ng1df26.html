 <B>DBCOMMIT()</B>
 Flush pending updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBCOMMIT() --&gt; NIL</B>

 <B>Returns</B>

     DBCOMMIT() always returns NIL.

 <B>Description</B>

     DBCOMMIT() causes all updates to the current work area to be written to
     disk.  All updated database and index buffers are written to DOS and a
     DOS COMMIT request is issued for the database (.dbf) file and any index
     files associated with the work area.

     DBCOMMIT() performs the same function as the standard COMMIT command
     except that it operates only on the current work area.  For more
     information, refer to the COMMIT command.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Network environment:</B> DBCOMMIT() makes database updates visible
        to other processes.  To insure data integrity, issue DBCOMMIT()
        before an UNLOCK operation.  For more information, refer to the
        "Network Programming" chapter in the Programming and Utilities Guide.

     <B>.</B>  DBCOMMIT() uses DOS interrupt 21h function 68h to perform the
        solid-disk write.  It is up to the network operating system to
        properly implement this request.  Check with the network vendor to
        see if this is supported.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  In this example, COMMIT is used to force a write to disk after
        a series of memory variables are assigned to field variables:

        USE Sales EXCLUSIVE NEW
        MEMVAR-&gt;Name := Sales-&gt;Name

        MEMVAR-&gt;Amount := Sales-&gt;Amount
        //
        @ 10, 10 GET MEMVAR-&gt;Name
        @ 11, 10 GET MEMVAR-&gt;Amount
        READ
        //
        IF UPDATED()
           APPEND BLANK
           REPLACE Sales-&gt;Name WITH MEMVAR-&gt;Name
           REPLACE Sales-&gt;Amount WITH MEMVAR-&gt;Amount
           Sales-&gt;( DBCOMMIT() )
        ENDIF
