 <B>SET DELETED</B>
 Toggle filtering of deleted records
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET DELETED on | OFF | &lt;xlToggle&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>ON</B> ignores deleted records.

     <B>OFF</B> processes deleted records.

     <B>&lt;xlToggle&gt;</B> is a logical expression that must be enclosed in
     parentheses.  A value of true (.T.) is the same as ON, and a value of
     false (.F.) is the same as OFF.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET DELETED toggles automatic filtering of records marked for deletion in
     all work areas.  When SET DELETED is ON, most commands ignore deleted
     records.  If, however, you refer to a record by record number (GOTO or any
     command that supports the RECORD scope), the record is not ignored even if
     marked for deletion.  Additionally, SET DELETED ON has no affect on INDEX
     or REINDEXing.

     RECALL ALL honors SET DELETED and does not recall any records.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Filtering deleted records in a single work area:</B> To confine
        the filtering of deleted records to a particular work area, SELECT
        the work area, and then SET FILTER TO DELETED().

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example illustrates the effect of using SET DELETED:

        USE Sales NEW
        ? LASTREC()                  // Result: 84
        //
        DELETE RECORD 4
        COUNT TO nCount
        ? nCount                     // Result: 84
        //
        SET DELETED ON
        COUNT TO nCount
        ? nCount                     // Result: 83
