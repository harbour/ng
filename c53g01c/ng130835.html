     <B>bitmaps                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an array of exactly two elements that indicates the bitmap
        files to be displayed.  The first element indicates the file name of
        the bitmap to be displayed when the check box is selected.  The
        second element indicates the file name of the bitmap to be displayed
        when the check box is not selected.

        Drive and directory names are not allowed; the file name extension is
        required.  A bitmap file can be stored as a file on disk or in a
        bitmap library.  If stored as a file, the file must reside in the
        same directory as the application.  If stored in a bitmap library,
        the library must reside in the same directory as the application and
        it also must have the same name as the application with a .bml
        extension.

        CA-Clipper will search for the file name first, and if it is not
        found, then search in the bitmap library.  If no file is found either
        on disk or in the library, no bitmap will be displayed.

        If this instance variable is not used, and the application is running
        in graphic mode, the files CHECK_F.BMU and CHECK_E.BMU will be used
        for the selected bitmap and unselected bitmap, respectively.

        This instance variable only affects applications running in graphic
        mode and is ignored in text mode.
