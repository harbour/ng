 <B>CLEAR MEMORY</B>
 Release all public and private variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CLEAR MEMORY</B>

 <B>Description</B>

     CLEAR MEMORY deletes both public and private memory variables from the
     memory variable table.  It operates in contrast to RELEASE ALL, which
     does not actually delete public and private memory variables but assigns
     NIL to those whose scope is the current procedure.  CLEAR MEMORY is the
     only way to delete all public memory variables from current memory.
     Local and static variables, however, are unaffected by CLEAR MEMORY.

     For more information on variables, refer to the Variables section of the
     "Basic Concepts" chapter in the Programming and Utilities Guide.
