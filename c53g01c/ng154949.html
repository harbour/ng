     <B>&lt;oRadioGroup&gt;:setStyle([&lt;cStyle&gt;]) --&gt; self</B>

        &lt;cStyle&gt; is a character string that indicates the characters that are
        used by the radio button's display() method.  The string must contain
        four characters.  The first is the left delimiter.  The second is the
        selected indicator.  The third is the unselected indicator.  The
        fourth character is the right delimiter.

        setStyle() is a method of the RadioGroup class that is used for
        uniformly setting the Style attribute of all the radio buttons in its
        group.  setStyle() accomplishes this by setting the Style of each of
        the radio buttons in its group to the value specified by &lt;cStyle&gt;.
