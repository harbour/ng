     <B>caption                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a character string that concisely describes the list box on
        the screen.

        When present, the <B>&amp;</B> character specifies that the character
        immediately following it in the caption is the list box's accelerator
        key. The accelerator key provides a quick and convenient mechanism
        for the user to move input focus from one data input control to a
        list box.  The user performs the selection by pressing the Alt key in
        combination with an accelerator key.  The case of an accelerator key
        is ignored.
