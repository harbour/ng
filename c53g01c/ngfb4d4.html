 <B>ZAP</B>
 Remove all records from the current database file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>ZAP</B>

 <B>Description</B>

     ZAP is a database command that permanently removes all records from
     files open in the current work area.  This includes the current database
     file, index files, and associated memo file.  Disk space previously
     occupied by the ZAPped files is released to the operating system.  ZAP
     performs the same operation as DELETE ALL followed by PACK, but is
     almost instantaneous in comparison.

     To ZAP in a network environment, the current database file must be USEd
     EXCLUSIVEly.  Refer to the "Network Programming" chapter in the
     Programming and Utilities Guide for more information.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates a typical ZAP operation in a network
        environment:

        USE Sales EXCLUSIVE NEW
        IF !NETERR()
           SET INDEX TO Sales, Branch, Salesman
           ZAP
           CLOSE Sales
        ELSE
           ? "Zap operation failed"
           BREAK
        ENDIF
