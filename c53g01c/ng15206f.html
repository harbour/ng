     <B>fBlock                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an optional code block that, when present, is evaluated each
        time the RadioGroup object receives or loses input focus.  The code
        block takes no implicit arguments.  Use the RadioGroup:hasFocus
        instance variable to determine if the radio group is receiving or
        losing input focus.  A value of true (.T.) indicates that it is
        receiving input focus; otherwise, a value of false (.F.) indicates
        that it is losing input focus.

        This code block is included in the RadioGroup class to provide a
        method of indicating when an input focus change event has occurred.
        The name "fBlock" refers to focus block.
