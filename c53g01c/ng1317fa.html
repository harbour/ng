     <B>fBlock                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an optional code block that, when present, is evaluated each
        time the CheckBox object receives or loses input focus.  The code
        block takes no implicit arguments.  Use CheckBox:hasFocus to
        determine if the check box is receiving or losing input focus.  A
        value of true (.T.) indicates that it is receiving input focus;
        otherwise, a value of false (.F.) indicates that it is losing input
        focus.

        This code block is included in the CheckBox class to provide a method
        of indicating when an input focus change event has occurred.  The
        name "fBlock" refers to focus block.
