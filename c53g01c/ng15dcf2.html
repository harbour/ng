     <B>skipBlock                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains a code block that repositions the data source.  During
        stabilization, this code block is executed with a numeric argument
        when the TBrowse object needs to reposition the data source.  The
        numeric argument passed to the block represents the number of records
        to be skipped.  A positive value means skip forward, and a negative
        value means skip backward.  A value of zero indicates that the data
        source does not need to be repositioned, but the current record may
        need to be refreshed.  Typically, the data source is a database file,
        and this block calls a user-defined function that executes a SKIP
        command to reposition the record pointer.

        The block must return the number of rows (positive, negative, or
        zero) actually skipped.  If the value returned is not the same as the
        value requested, the TBrowse object assumes that the skip operation
        encountered the beginning or end of file.
