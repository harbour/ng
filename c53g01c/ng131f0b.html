        that are used by the check box's display() method.  The string must
        contain four characters.  The first is the left delimiter.  Its
        default value is the left square bracket ([) character.  The second
        is the checked indicator.  Its default value is the square root
        character.  The third is the unchecked indicator.  Its default is the
        space character (" ").  The fourth character is the right delimiter.
        Its default value is the right square bracket (]) character.
