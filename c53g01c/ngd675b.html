 <B>RECALL</B>
 Restore records marked for deletion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>RECALL [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to RECALL.  The
     default scope is the current record, or NEXT 1.  If a condition is
     specified, the default scope becomes ALL.

     <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the
     condition from the current record until the condition fails.

     <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records to RECALL
     within the given scope.

 <B>Description</B>

     RECALL is a database command that restores records marked for deletion
     in the current work area.  This is the inverse of the DELETE command.
     If DELETED is ON, RECALL can restore the current record or a specific
     record, if you specify a RECORD scope.  Note that once you PACK a
     database file, all marked records have been physically removed from the
     file and cannot be recovered.

     In a network environment, RECALLing the current record requires an
     RLOCK().  RECALLing several records requires an FLOCK() or EXCLUSIVE USE
     of the current database file.  Refer to the "Network Programming"
     chapter in the Programming and Utilities Guide for more information.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This examples show the results of RECALL:

        USE Sales NEW
        //
        DELETE RECORD 4
        ? DELETED()               // Result: .T.
        //
        RECALL
        ? DELETED()               // Result: .F.
