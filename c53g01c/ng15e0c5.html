        Contains a logical value indicating whether the TBrowse object is
        stable.  It contains true (.T.) if the TBrowse object is stable;
        otherwise, it contains false (.F.).  The browse is considered stable
        when all data has been retrieved and displayed, the data source has
        been repositioned to the record corresponding to the browse cursor,
        and the current cell has been highlighted.  When navigation messages
        are sent to the TBrowse object, TBrowse:stable is set to false (.F.).
        After stabilization is performed using the TBrowse:stabilize()
        message, TBrowse:stable is set to true (.T.).
