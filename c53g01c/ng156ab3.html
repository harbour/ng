     <B>sblock                                          (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an optional code block that, when present, is evaluated
        immediately after the ScrollBar object's state changes.  The code
        block takes no implicit arguments.

        This code block is included in the ScrollBar class to provide a
        method of indicating when a state change event has occurred.  The
        name "sblock" refers to state block.
