 <B>@...GET RADIOGROUP</B>
 Create a new radio button group Get object and display it to the screen
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>@ &lt;nTop&gt;, &lt;nLeft&gt;, &lt;nBottom&gt;, &lt;nRight&gt;</B>
     <B>   GET &lt;nVar|cVar&gt;</B>
     <B>   RADIOGROUP &lt;aGroup&gt;</B>

     <B>      [MESSAGE &lt;cMessage&gt;]</B>
     <B>      [COLOR &lt;cColorString&gt;]</B>
     <B>      [FOCUS] &lt;fblock&gt;</B>
     <B>      [WHEN &lt;lPreExpression&gt;]</B>
     <B>      [VALID &lt;lPostExpression&gt;]</B>
     <B>      [SEND &lt;msg&gt;]</B>
     <B>      [GUISEND &lt;guimsg&gt;]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nTop&gt;</B>, <B>&lt;nLeft&gt;</B>, <B>&lt;nBottom&gt;</B> and <B>&lt;nRight&gt;</B> specify the
     screen position for the radio button group and its caption.  Output
     which extends beyond the visible extent of the display is clipped and
     does not appear.

     <B>GET &lt;nVar|cVar&gt;</B> specifies the name of the variable associated with
     the GET.  Its value indicates which radio button (if any) in the group
     is selected.  A numeric value refers to the position in the group of the
     selected button.  A value of 0 indicates no selected button.  A
     character string value refers to the data or text contained within the
     selected button.  A character string that does not refer to any item in
     the list indicates no selected item.

     <B>RADIOGROUP &lt;aGroup&gt;</B> specifies an array of RadioButto objects.

     <B>CAPTION &lt;cCaption&gt;</B> specifies a character string that concisely
     describes the GET on the screen.  Caption differs from the SAY argument
     in two ways.  The first is that the caption is displayed each time the
     GET is shown on the screen.  The other difference is that the caption,
     along with its screen position is maintained within the Get object.
     This allows the GET to receive input when the mouse's left button is
     clicked and its cursor is on the caption.  By default, the caption
     appears in the top-left border of the GET.  Use the Get object's capRow
     or capCol variable to change the screen position of the caption.

     When present, the <B>&amp;</B> character specifies that the character
     immediately following it in the caption is the radio group's accelerator
     key. The accelerator key provides a quick and convenient mechanism for
     the user to move input focus from one data input control to the radio
     group.  The case of an accelerator key is ignored.

     <B>MESSAGE &lt;cMessage&gt;</B> specifies a character string that is displayed on
     the Get system's status bar line when the GET has input focus.
     Typically, it describes the anticipated contents or user response of the
     GET.  Refer to the READ command for details pertaining to the Get
     system's status bar.

     <B>COLOR &lt;cColorString&gt;</B> defines the color settings for the radio button
     group.  &lt;cColorString&gt; is a character expression containing exactly
     three color settings.

     3            The radio group caption's accelerator key  Background
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>FOCUS &lt;fblock&gt;</B> specifies a code block that is evaluated each time
     the radio button group receives focus.  The code block takes no implicit
     arguments.  Use the RadioGroup:hasFocus instance variable to determine
     if the radio group has focus.

     <B>WHEN &lt;lPreExpression&gt;</B> specifies an expression that must be satisfied
     before the cursor can enter the GET during a READ.  The expression can
     optionally be a code block.  The Get object is passed as a parameter to
     the code block.

     <B>VALID &lt;lPostExpression&gt;</B> specifies an expression that must be
     satisfied before the cursor can leave the GET during a READ.  The
     expression can optionally be a code block.  The Get object is passed as
     a parameter to the code block.

     <B>Note: </B> There is no STATE clause for the @...GET RADIOGROUP command.
     Instead each radio button in the group can have its own sBlock instance
     variable.  See  sBlock under RadioButto class for more details.

     <B>SEND &lt;msg&gt;</B> sends the specified message to the Get object.  &lt;msg&gt; is
     sent before the GET is displayed.  Any message can be sent, including
     method calls and instance variable assignments.  Method calls must
     include parentheses even if no arguments are passed.

     <B>GUISEND &lt;guimsg&gt;</B> can be used to send a message (such as the
     display() method) to a GUI object.  The GUI objects available in
     CA-Clipper are check boxes, list boxes, push buttons, and radio button
     groups.  To send a message to a non-GUI object, such as standard GETs
     and TBrowses, use the SEND clause.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates how to add a radio button group to a
        data entry screen.  It utilizes a position-oriented method of
        selection:

        nColor := 1            //default to the first item.
        aGroup := ARRAY( 3 )
        aGroup[ 1 ] := RadioButto( 6, 22, "&amp;Red" )
        aGroup[ 2 ] := RadioButto( 7, 22, "&amp;Green" )
        aGroup[ 3 ] := RadioButto( 8, 22, "&amp;Blue" )
        @ 5, 20, 9, 40 GET nColor RADIOGROUP aGroup

       The nColor variable will return a position, in this case 1, 2, or 3.

     <B>.</B>  This example demonstrates a radio button group that utilizes a
        data-oriented method of selection:

        cColor := "R"          //default to red.
        aGroup := ARRAY( 3 )
        aGroup[ 1 ] := RadioButto( 6, 22, "&amp;Red", "R" )
        aGroup[ 2 ] := RadioButto( 7, 22, "&amp;Green", "G" )
        aGroup[ 3 ] := RadioButto( 8, 22, "&amp;Blue", "B" )
        @ 5, 15, 9, 40 GET cColor RADIOGROUP aGroup

       The nColor variable will return data, in this case "R", "G", or "B".
