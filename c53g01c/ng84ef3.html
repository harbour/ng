 <B>ORDKEYDEL()</B>
 Delete a key from a custom built order
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>ORDKEYDEL([&lt;cOrder&gt; | &lt;nPosition&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;cIndexFile&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;expKeyValue&gt;]) --&gt; lSuccess</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cOrder&gt; | &lt;nPosition&gt;</B> is the name of the order or a number
     representing its position in the order list.  Using the order name is
     the preferred method since the position may be difficult to determine
     using multiple-order index files.  If omitted or NIL, the controlling
     order is assumed.

     Specifying an invalid order, such as one that is not custom built, will
     raise a runtime error.

     <B>&lt;cIndexFile&gt;</B> is the name of an index file, including an optional
     drive and directory (no extension should be specified).  Use this
     argument with &lt;cOrder&gt; to remove ambiguity when there are two or more
     orders with the same name in different index files.

     If &lt;cIndexFile&gt; is not open by the current process, a runtime error is
     raised.

     <B>&lt;expKeyValue&gt;</B> is a specific key value that you want to delete for
     the current record.  The data type must match that of the order.  If not
     specified, the order's key expression is evaluated for the current
     record and deleted from the order.

 <B>Returns</B>

     ORDKEYDEL() returns true (.T.) if successful; otherwise, it returns
     false (.F.).

 <B>Description</B>

     ORDKEYDEL() deletes a key from a custom built order which is an order
     that is not automatically maintained by the DBFCDX driver.  You can
     determine if an order is custom built using DBORDERINFO(DBOI_CUSTOM,
     ...).  When you create such an order, it is initially empty.  You must
     then manually add and delete keys using ORDKEYADD() and ORDKEYDEL().

     <B>Note: </B> An existing order can be changed to a custom built order by
     using the DBORDERINFO() function.

     ORDKEYDEL() evaluates the key expression (or &lt;expKeyValue&gt;, if
     specified), and then deletes the key for the current record from the
     order.

     ORDKEYDEL() will fail if:

     <B>.</B>  The record pointer is positioned on an invalid record (for
        example, EOF() returns true (.T.) or the record pointer is positioned
        on a record that falls outside the order's scope or for condition)

     <B>.</B>  The specified order is not custom built

     <B>.</B>  The specified order does not exist

     <B>.</B>  No order was specified and there is no controlling order

     By default, this function operates on the currently selected work area.
     It will operate on an unselected work area if you specify it as part of
     an aliased expression.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example creates a custom index, adds every fiftieth
        record to it, and deletes every hundredth record:

        USE Customer VIA "DBFCDX"
        // Create custom-built order that is initially empty
        INDEX ON LastName TO Last CUSTOM

        // Add every 50th record
        FOR n := 1 TO RECCOUNT() STEP 50
           GOTO n
           ORDKEYADD()
        NEXT

        // Remove every 100th record
        FOR n := 1 TO RECCOUNT() STEP 100
           GOTO n
           ORDKEYDEL()
        NEXT
