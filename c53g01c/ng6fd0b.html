 <B>MEMOSETSUPER()</B>
 Set an RDD inheritance chain for the DBFMEMO database driver
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>MEMOSETSUPER([&lt;cSuperRDD&gt;]) --&gt; cOldSuperName</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cSuperRDD&gt;</B> is a character string representing the name of the RDD
     from which DBFMEMO will inherit.

 <B>Returns</B>

     MEMOSETSUPER() always returns NIL.

 <B>Description</B>

     The DBFMEMO driver is only capable of handling commands and functions
     that relate to memo fields.  Therefore, it must inherit the non-memo
     database characteristics (such as SKIP, REPLACE, SEEK, etc.) from a
     "super" driver (such as DBFNTX).

     For example, the DBFCDX RDD is nothing more than the DBFMEMO RDD
     hardwired to inherit database characteristics from the _DBFCDX RDD.
     That is, when you use the DBFCDX RDD, you are using the DBFMEMO driver
     to handle the memo field operations and you are using the _DBFCDX driver
     to handle the other database and index operations as the "super" driver.

     At times, you may want to use a database driver such as DBFNTX instead
     of DBFCDX but, at the same time, have the efficient and enhanced memo
     field capabilities of the DBFMEMO RDD instead of the DBT memo file
     format.  In order to do this, you would use MEMOSETSUPER().

     <B>Warning! </B> The MEMOSETSUPER() function can only set one inheritance
     chain per application instance.  That is, once you have set
     MEMOSETSUPER() in an application, MEMOSETSUPER() cannot be changed.
     Doing so will have unpredictable results.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example uses MEMOSETSUPER() to create a database (.dbf)
        file with an .fpt/.dbv memo field:

        REQUEST DBFMEMO
        // Set the default to DBFMEMO
        RDDSETDEFAULT( "DBFMEMO" )
        // Make DBFMEMO inherit from DBFNTX
        MEMOSETSUPER( "DBFNTX" )

        // Create a DBF with an FPT/DBV not DBT
        dbCreate( "test.dbf", {{"notes", "M", 10, 0}} )

        // Open DBF with FPT/DBV
        // Indexes created would be NTX if created
        USE test NEW
