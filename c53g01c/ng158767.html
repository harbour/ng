     <B>colorBlock                                       (Assignable)</B>

        Contains an optional code block that determines the color of data
        items as they are displayed.  If present, this block is executed each
        time a new value is retrieved via the TBColumn:block (the data
        retrieval block).  The newly retrieved data value is passed as an
        argument to the TBColumn:colorBlock, which must return an array
        containing four numeric values.  The values returned are used as
        indexes into the color table of the TBrowse object as described in
        the TBColumn:defColor reference below.

        The TBColumn:colorBlock allows display colors for data items based on
        the value of the data being displayed.  For example, negative numbers
        may be displayed in a different color than positive numbers.

        <B>Note: </B> The colors available to a DOS application are more limited
        than those for a Windows application.  The only colors available to
        you here are listed in the drop-down list box of the Properties
        Workbench window for that item.
