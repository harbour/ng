 <B>SET CONFIRM</B>
 Toggle required exit key to terminate GETs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SET CONFIRM on | OFF | &lt;xlToggle&gt;</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>ON</B> requires the user to press an exit key to leave a GET.

     <B>OFF</B> allows the user to leave a GET by typing past the end without
     pressing an exit key.

     <B>&lt;xlToggle&gt;</B> is a logical expression that must be enclosed in
     parentheses.  A value of true (.T.) is the same as ON, and a value of
     false (.F.) is the same as OFF.

 <B>Description</B>

     SET CONFIRM determines whether an exit key is required to leave a GET.
     If CONFIRM is OFF, the user can type past the end of a GET and the
     cursor will move to the next GET, if there is one.  If there is not
     another GET, the READ terminates.  If, however, CONFIRM is ON, an exit
     key must be pressed to leave the current GET.

     In all cases, attempting to leave the current GET executes the RANGE or
     VALID clauses, unless the user presses the Esc key.

     See @...GET for more information on the behavior of GETs.
