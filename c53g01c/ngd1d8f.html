 List records to the console
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>LIST &lt;exp list&gt;</B>
     <B>   [TO PRINTER] [TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;scope&gt;] [WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;] [OFF]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;exp list&gt;</B> is the list of expressions to be evaluated and displayed
     for each record processed.

     <B>TO PRINTER</B> echoes output to the printer.

     <B>TO FILE &lt;xcFile&gt;</B> echoes output to the specified file name and can be
     specified either as a literal file name or as a character expression
     enclosed in parentheses.  If an extension is not specified, .txt is
     added.

     <B>&lt;scope&gt;</B> is the portion of the current database file to LIST.  The
     default is ALL records.

     <B>WHILE &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the set of records meeting the
     condition from the current record until the condition fails.

     <B>FOR &lt;lCondition&gt;</B> specifies the conditional set of records to LIST
     within the given scope.

     <B>OFF</B> suppresses the display of record numbers.

 <B>Description</B>

     LIST is a console command that sequentially accesses records in the
     current work area, displaying the results of one or more expressions for
     each record accessed.  The output is in tabular format with each column
     separated by a space.  LIST is identical to DISPLAY with the exception
     that its default scope is ALL rather than NEXT 1.

     When invoked, output is sent to the screen and, optionally, to the
     printer and/or a file.  To suppress output to the screen while printing
     or echoing output to a file, SET CONSOLE OFF before the LIST invocation.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Interrupting LIST:</B> So the user may interrupt a LIST, use
        INKEY() as part of the FOR condition to test for an interrupt key
        press.  See the example below.

     <B>.  Printer margin:</B> LIST honors the current SET MARGIN for output
        echoed to the printer.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  In this example, a simple list is followed by a conditional
        list to the printer:

        USE Sales
        LIST DATE(), TIME(), Branch
        LIST Branch, Salesman FOR Amount &gt; 500 TO PRINTER

     <B>.</B>  This example interrupts LIST using INKEY() to test whether the
        user pressed the Esc key:

        #define K_ESC     27
        USE Sales INDEX Salesman NEW
        LIST Branch, Salesman, Amount WHILE INKEY() != K_ESC
