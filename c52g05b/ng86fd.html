 <B>91  CHANGED: @...GET</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. <B>VALID and RANGE:</B>  In Clipper 5.0, the VALID and RANGE clauses
        are mutually exclusive (i.e., you cannot specify both in the
        same command).

     2. <B>Invalid dates:</B>  In Summer '87, entering an invalid date
        cleared the date field and homed the cursor.  Pressing Esc left
        the field display blank, but the original value was restored to
        the Get variable.  In Clipper 5.0, the cursor stays in the date
        field at the current position so the field can be edited, but
        the field is not cleared.  Pressing Esc to quit the READ
        restores the initial value in the display and the original value
        is restored to the Get variable.

     3. <B>Pressing Esc:</B>  In Clipper 5.0, pressing Esc while SET ESCAPE
        is ON not only restores the previous value for the current GET
        variable but also redisplays the previous value on the screen.
        Summer '87 did not redisplay the previous value.

     4. <B>Color behavior:</B>  In Clipper 5.0, the color of a Get variable
        is fixed at the time of the @...GET.  This means that when a
        READ is executed the Get variable retains its original color.

     5. <B>Clipping behavior:</B>  In Summer '87, a Get variable that
        attempted to display past column 80 wrapped to the next line.
        In Clipper 5.0, a Get variable that attempts to display past
        MAXCOL() is clipped.
