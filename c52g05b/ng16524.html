 <B>1   Memory Management</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In Clipper 5.01, there have been many improvements made to the
     memory management.  These include:

     1.  The virtual memory system has been improved to make better use
         of available conventional memory.

     2.  Conventional memory requirements have been reduced by 20K-30K.

     3.  Performance in tight memory situations has been improved.

     4.  New "runtime warnings" have been implemented to allow graceful
         handling of low memory conditions.
