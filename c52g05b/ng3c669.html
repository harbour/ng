 <B>6   MEMVAR Storage Class</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     MEMVAR is the storage class of PRIVATE and PUBLIC variables.  These
     variables are more complex than LOCAL or STATIC variables because
     they consist of more than just a VALUE: they also have an
     associated symbolic name that allows them to be referred to by name
     during execution (e.g., in macros).  MEMVAR variables are stored in
     a dedicated virtual memory segment.  Pushing a MEMVAR involves
     locating the VALUE that is currently associated with the variable's
     name and copying that VALUE onto the Eval Stack.
