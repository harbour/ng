 <B>49  CHANGED: SET()</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  The SET() function has been revised to take a third parameter
         for these settings:

         _SET_ALTFILE
         _SET_PRINTFILE
         _SET_EXTRAFILE

         The third parameter is a logical value indicating whether or
         not the specified file should be truncated or opened in append
         mode.  A value of false (.F.) means the file should be
         truncated.  A value of true (.T.) means the file should be
         opened in append mode.  In either case, if the file does not
         exist, it is created.

     2.  A new global setting, _SET_SCROLLBREAK, has been added.  This
         setting determines how Ctrl-S is interpreted by the keyboard
         driver.  When _SET_SCROLLBREAK is true (.T.) Ctrl-S is
         interpreted as a request to pause execution upon the next
         attempt to perform output via Clipper.  When _SET_SCROLLBREAK
         is false (.F.) Ctrl-S is interpreted as a data or cursor
         control key.
