 <B>NEW:      Reference</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CA-Clipper 5.2 provides many new and enhanced (changed) commands and
     functions that can be used to access and manipulate databases and get
     specific information about the replaceable database driver (RDD) in use.
     These new and existing language elements, those that were changed to
     accommodate the new RDD architecture, are documented in the new Drivers
     guide.
