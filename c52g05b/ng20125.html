--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Inspect option, previously located in the Watch menu has been
     removed.  Inspection of Watchpoints and Tracepoints is accomplished
     by selecting the Watch Window which is open on the main Debugger
     screen as long as a Watchpoint or Tracepoint is set.
