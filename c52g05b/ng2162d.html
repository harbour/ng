 <B>145 CHANGED: Command Window</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In Clipper 5.01 Debugger, the Command Window has been enhanced:

     1.  The Command Window is now treated like other windows.  It can
         be selected, sized, zoomed, etc...

     2.  The Command Window prompt has been changed from the hash sign
         (#) to the greater than sign (&gt;).

     3.  The Command Window now has command history.  Each command is
         saved after it is executed to a history buffer.  Previous
         commands can be accessed by pressing Uparrow.  Pressing F2 Zoom
         displays an extended list of previous commands.

     4.  Commands can be entered at any time, regardless of which window
         is currently active.
