 <B>NEW:      EXIT PROCEDURE</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The EXIT PROCEDURE statement declares a procedure that will be executed
     on program termination.  EXIT procedures are called after the last
     executable statement in a CA-Clipper application has completed.  EXIT
     PROCEDUREs can be used to perform common housekeeping tasks such as
     saving configuration settings to a file, closing a log file or
     concluding a communications session.
