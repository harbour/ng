 <B>170 NEW: Linker</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Clipper 5.0 has a new linker, .RTLink for Clipper, which is
     designed to make it easier to create large programs without the
     headache of creating overlays as was required by PLINK-86.  In
     particular, the following are the areas of improvement that .RTLink
     for Clipper represents:

     1.  <B>Dynamic overlays:</B>  All Clipper-compiled code is
         automatically overlayed.  Dynamic overlays can be either
         internal or external.  That is, they can be either bound into
         the executable (.EXE) file or placed in a separate overlay
         (.OVL) file.

     2.  <B>Incremental linking of Clipper-compiled code:</B>  For very
         large Clipper-generated object files, .RTLink will link only
         procedures and user-defined functions that have changed since
         the last link.  Note, for small modules the actual speed of
         linking might be slower.

     3.  <B>Pre-linking of existing libraries and object files:</B> .RTLink
         will create pre-linked portions of libraries and object files to
         a .PLL file.  Use this feature to speed linking or if you want
         more than one .EXE file to share the same library code, thereby
         saving disk space.

         Note that the installation program generates BASE50.PLL
         containing most of CLIPPER.LIB.  Using this pre-linked library
         will make linking of programs at development-time many times
         faster than without it.  Assuming the \BIN directory is in your
         path, typical linking syntax is:

         C&gt;RTLINK FI &lt;objList&gt; /PLL:BASE50

     4.  <B>Static overlaying of C and Assembler code:</B>  Static
         overlaying is still supported for C and Assembler in the same
         way it was with PLINK-86.

     5.  <B>Common syntax compatibility:</B>  .RTLink supports both
         Microsoft Link (positional) and PLINK-86 (freeformat)
         compatible syntax.
