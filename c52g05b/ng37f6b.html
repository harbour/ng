 <B>11  Symbol Tables</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Clipper maintains symbol information at runtime in order to support
     symbolic references to variables and functions.  Some symbol
     information is embedded in the .EXE file (the Clipper 5.0 version of
     .RTLink eliminates duplication among symbols from compiled Clipper
     modules).  Other symbols are created dynamically at runtime.

     Memory for symbol tables and related information is allocated using the
     fixed memory allocator.  The symbols are allocated in blocks and do not
     fragment memory.  However, excessive dynamic symbol creation (e.g.,
     large numbers of MEMVAR variables created via macros) may cause the
     symbol tables to grow, reducing swap space.
