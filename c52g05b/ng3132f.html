 <B>4   What is .RTLink error "eut0032"?</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This message appears to have three possible causes:

     1.  There are Summer '87 compiled .OBJs or .LIBs in the current
         directory, or they appear in directories referenced in the LIB or
         OBJ environment variables, or Summer '87 .OBJs or .LIBs are
         referenced via a DOS APPEND command.  The Clipper version of
         .RTLink is not compatible with Summer '87 compiled programs.

     2.  A function or procedure has been defined twice.  Removal of the
         duplicate declaration will solve the problem.

     3.  Some reports indicate this error may occur because a single object
         module was very large.  If neither of the above solutions
         eliminates this error message, and you have one or more .OBJ files
         larger than 64K, try compiling your (.prg) files individually using
         the /M compiler option.  Make sure to supply all of the resultant
         .OBJ files to .RTLink for linking.  For more information on
         compiler options and linking multiple .OBJ files, refer to Chapters
         3 and 4 of your Programming and Utilities Guide.
