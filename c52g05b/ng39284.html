 <B>1   Early and Late Evaluation of Macros in Code Blocks</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     When a code block contains a macro, an ambiguity arises regarding
     when the macro is evaluated.  There are two possibilities, early or
     late evaluation.

   <B>Early Evaluation</B>

     The macro is expanded at the time the code block is created, and
     the expanded value remains constant for all subsequent evaluations
     of the block.

     Clipper 5.0 uses early evaluation by default, with an alternate
     method available for late evaluation.

     As an example of early evaluation, consider a SET FILTER command in
     which the filter expression is a macro:

     SET FILTER TO &amp;cFilter

     A filter expression, specified by a SET FILTER command, is executed
     each time a SKIP command is issued.  The macro string contained in
     cFilter above, however, should be expanded only once, when the
     command is first issued.  Otherwise, if the macro is re-expanded
     each time the filter block is evaluated, the macro variable
     (cFilter above) must be preserved for the duration of the filter.

     In Clipper 5.0, the SET FILTER command is implemented by use of a
     code block.  The code for the above command, after preprocessing,
     is similar to the following example:

     DBFILTER( { || &amp;cFilter } )

     Early evaluation of the macro within the code block results in the
     desired behavior: cFilter is evaluated when the block is defined
     (as part of the creation of the block).  The block is created via
     the macro system and remains constant through all subsequent block
     evaluations, regardless of any change to the value of cFilter.

   <B>Late Evaluation</B>

     The macro is re-evaluated each time the block is evaluated.

     As an example of a situation where late evaluation is required,
     consider a block which must perform a macro operation on one of its
     own parameters.

     The following block attempts to assign a value to a variable by use
     of a macro:

     assignVarByNameBlock := { |vName, value| &amp;vName := value }

     Because Clipper 5.0 implements early evaluation, this code block
     would not have the desired effect: instead of evaluating the macro
     each time the block is run, Clipper would evaluate the macro when
     the block was first created.  The initial value of vName would
     become part of the block.

     Late evaluation is available by using a macro expression.  The
     above code block will function correctly if defined as follows:

     assignVarByNameBlock := { |vName, value| &amp;(vName) := value }

     The use of a macro expression (the macro operator applied to a
     parenthesized expression) prevents the early evaluation from taking
     place, and the code block will re-evaluate the macro string
     contained in vName during each block evaluation.
