 <B>56  CHANGED: MEMOEDIT()</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A header file, Memoedit.ch, is provided to make MEMOEDIT() more
     readable.

     The MEMOEDIT() function in Clipper 5.0 uses a slightly different
     formatting algorithm than in previous versions.  The change
     concerns the way soft carriage return/line feed (soft-CRLF)
     characters are inserted into the text when word-wrap occurs under
     MEMOEDIT().

     In Summer '87, if a single word is wrapped and later reformatted
     with a greater line width, the word will appear as two words
     because the soft-CRLF is replaced with a space.  In Clipper 5.0,
     the insertion of soft-CRLF characters is never allowed to change
     the significant content of the text.  The new method leaves the
     text in its original form and properly handles the case where a
     soft-CRLF has been inserted in the middle of a word.

     If a text string formatted using Summer '87 MEMOEDIT() is viewed
     using Clipper 5.0 MEMOEDIT(), words that were separated by a
     soft-CRLF will be run together because the soft-CRLF is not
     replaced with a space.  To prevent this, you can either change all
     soft-CRLF pairs into space characters using STRTRAN(), or you can
     use the supplied utility DBT50.EXE.  DBT50.EXE scans an entire .dbt
     file, replacing any soft-CRLF pair with two spaces.  Although this
     has the undesirable effect of causing certain words to be separated
     by two spaces instead of one, it allows the file to be processed in
     place without using additional disk space.
