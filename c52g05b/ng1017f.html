 <B>166 NEW: Code Blocks</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Code blocks have been added to Clipper 5.0 as a new data type.
     Code blocks allow compiled code to be treated as data which
     provides a capability similar to macros.

     Like other data types, code blocks can be assigned to variables,
     passed as arguments and returned from functions.  Whenever desired,
     a code block can be evaluated.  This executes the code in the block
     and returns its result.

     A code block can also be declared with block parameters, which
     behave like the formal parameters of a function or procedure.
     Parameter values can then be supplied each time the block is
     evaluated.
