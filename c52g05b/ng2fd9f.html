 <B>1   Why are my 5.0 .EXEs larger than Summer '87?</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Clipper 5.0 executable (.EXE) files are often (though not always)
     larger than equivalent Summer '87 executables.  Generally, this is
     because of the increased size of the Clipper runtime support system
     (the support code is larger because of the larger feature set in
     Clipper 5.0 and because the runtime system is more modular than in
     previous releases).

     <B>Note:</B>  The amount of memory needed to successfully run a Clipper
     5.0 application is only indirectly related to the size of the
     executable file.  In particular, increasing the amount of compiled
     Clipper (.prg) code in an application has very little effect on the
     amount of memory required to run the application.  This is because all
     compiled Clipper code is automatically placed into dynamic overlays by
     .RTLink.  Dynamically overlayed code is paged in and out of memory as
     needed during execution; the amount of compiled Clipper code affects
     the .EXE size but not the amount of memory required to run the
     application.

     In some cases the physical size of the .EXE file (as opposed to the
     amount of memory needed for execution) is a concern.  An example would
     be a large application that you wish to distribute on floppy disks.
     Clipper 5.0 offers several options for breaking an application into
     multiple files.  For more information, refer to Chapter 4 of your
     Programming and Utilities Guide.

     Compiling with the debugging option (/B) increases the size of the .EXE
     file.  When you are through debugging your application, you should
     recompile it without the debugging option.  Compiling with the /L
     option (omit line number information) reduces the size of your .EXE
     file.  For information on these options, refer to Chapter 3 of your
     Programming and Utilities Guide.

     For information about how .RTLink creates dynamic overlays (and how to
     statically overlay non-Clipper code), refer to Chapter 4 of your
     Programming and Utilities Guide.

     For information about how dynamic overlays are handled during execution
     (and other runtime memory management issues), refer to Release Note #6.

     For information about determining how much memory is required to run
     5.0 applications, see below.
