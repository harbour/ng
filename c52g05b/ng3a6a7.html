 <B>1   Memo Fields and Soft Carriage Returns in Clipper 5.0</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The text handling (memo) functions in Clipper 5.0 use a slightly
     different formatting algorithm than in previous versions.  The
     change concerns the way soft carriage return/line feed characters
     are inserted into the text when word-wrapping occurs under
     MEMOEDIT().

     Under either version, word-wrapping occurs when a line of text is
     too wide to fit within the line width specified in the call to
     MEMOEDIT().  The line is broken into two lines by inserting a soft
     carriage return/line feed after the right-most word that will fit
     within the specified line width.

     In the Summer '87 version of MEMOEDIT(), when a soft carriage
     return/line feed is inserted, a single space character is removed
     from the text at the point where the soft carriage return/line feed
     is inserted.  If the text is later reformatted using a different
     line width, each soft carriage return/line feed is replaced by a
     single space.  This generally results in equivalent text,
     regardless of the formatting width.  A problem arises, however, if
     a single word is too long to fit within the specified line width.
     In this case, a soft carriage return/line feed is inserted in the
     middle of the word.  If the text is later reformatted with a
     greater line width, the word will appear as two words because the
     soft carriage return/line feed is replaced with a space.

     In Clipper 5.0, the insertion of soft carriage return/line feed
     characters is never allowed to change the significant content of
     the text.  That is, when a soft carriage return/line feed is
     inserted between two words, the space characters between the two
     words are preserved.  When text is reformatted, any soft carriage
     return/line feed characters are simply removed.  This leaves the
     text in its original form and properly handles the case where a
     soft carriage return/line feed has been inserted in the middle of a
     word.

     If a text string formatted using Summer '87 MEMOEDIT() is
     reformatted using any of the 5.0 text handling functions, words
     that were separated by a soft carriage return/line feed will be run
     together because the soft carriage return/line feed is not replaced
     with a space.

     To prevent this, text that was formatted using Summer '87
     MEMOEDIT() should be processed to change any soft carriage
     return/line feed pairs into space characters.  This can be
     accomplished using the STRTRAN() function.

       STRTRAN( &lt;text&gt;, CHR(141)+CHR(10), " " )

     To convert memo values in an existing database, the following two
     line program can be used:

       USE &lt;xcDatabase&gt;
       REPLACE ALL &lt;idMemo&gt; WITH ;
         STRTRAN( &lt;idMemo&gt;, CHR(141)+CHR(10), " " )

     Because of the (.dbt) file format, replacing all occurrences of a
     memo field can cause the (.dbt) file to grow significantly.  The
     (.dbt) file can be reduced by copying the (.dbf) to a new file.

     For very large (.dbt) files, it may not be feasible to perform the
     above procedure.  The supplied utility program, DBT50.EXE located
     in \CLIPPER5\BIN, may be useful in these cases.  DBT50 scans an
     entire (.dbt) file, replacing any soft carriage return/line feed
     pairs with two spaces.  Although this has the undesirable effect of
     causing certain words to be separated by two spaces instead of one,
     it allows the file to be processed in place without using
     additional disk space.  DBT50 modifies only soft carriage
     return/line feed pairs in the target file.  Other text is
     unaffected.

     Whatever method is chosen, the translation should be performed
     before text in the target file is reformatted and written using the
     Clipper 5.0 MEMOEDIT() function.

     As with any file upgrade operation, you should make backup copies
     of the affected files before operating on them.
