 <B>106 CHANGED: PICTURE functions</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The following PICTURE functions have been changed from Summer '87
     to Clipper 5.0:

     1. <B>@B:</B>  An @...GET variable using this PICTURE function is
        right-justified when the GET initially receives input focus.  As
        soon as you start typing, the value is left-justified.  When the
        variable does not have input focus, it is left-justified.

     2. <B>@S:</B>  Instead of waiting until the cursor is at the end of
        the Get to start scrolling, characters begin scrolling when the
        cursor is somewhere in the middle of the Get.

     3. <B>@Z:</B>  The zero appears for an @...GET variable when the GET
        has input focus; otherwise, the zero is displayed as a blank.
