 <B>CHANGED:  RL (Report Label) Utility</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>.FRM file changes</B>

     The Report and Label utility (RL) formatted report headings as fixed-
     length strings prior to saving them to the .FRM file.  This caused
     report headings to be lost when the .FRM file was read by dBASE III
     PLUS.  CA-Clipper 5.2 corrects this.  Compatibility with previous
     versions of RL has been preserved.  If dBASE III PLUS .FRM file
     compatibility is required, simply load the .FRM into RL and save it back
     to disk.

     <B>Embedded semicolons in Report Headings</B>

     RL no longer lets you embed semicolons in report headings.  This is
     consistent with dBASE III PLUS.

     <B>Right Margin setting</B>

     RL no longer allows the right margin setting to exceed the width of the
     report.
