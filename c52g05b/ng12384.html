 <B>172 NEW: Debugger</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Clipper 5.0 has a new source code debugger, CLD.EXE, that allows
     you to debug source code as it executes.  The debugger has a number
     of features including: Breakpoints that cause execution to pause
     when a specified point in the source code is reached; Watchpoints
     that allow you to monitor the values of variables or expressions;
     Tracepoints that cause execution to pause when the value of a
     specified expression changes; and a Callstack Window that allows
     you to view all pending procedure and code block activations.

     The Debugger library file, CLD.LIB, is provided so that you can
     link the Debugger into your application as an object file.  Using
     this feature, the Debugger can be called while the application is
     running without the presence of CLD.EXE.  The Alt-D key is used to
     invoke the Debugger when it is linked and ALTD() controls the use
     of the Alt-D key.
