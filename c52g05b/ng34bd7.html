 <B>1   Virtual Memory Manager (VMM)</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>Virtual memory</B> is a generic term for hardware or software
     techniques that allow a limited amount of <B>real</B> memory to emulate a
     much larger <B>virtual</B> memory.

     The Clipper 5.0 Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) is implemented in the
     software.  The system runs in real mode on any 8086-compatible
     processor; it does not directly use the protected mode virtual memory
     capabilities of the Intel 286 and 386 processors.

     The VMM is a <B>segmented</B> memory manager.  Virtual memory is allocated
     in segments, each of which may contain from 1K to 64K of data.
     Initially, the VMM works somewhat like a normal memory allocator
     (although it has an extra advantage: most VM segments are movable; the
     VMM can reorganize them to get maximum utilization of real memory).
     Unlike a normal memory allocator, however, the VMM does not <B>run out</B>
     when the available real memory can no longer contain all of the
     allocated segments.  Instead, one or more of the least recently used
     (LRU) segments are <B>swapped out</B> into secondary storage (or otherwise
     removed from real memory, see below) to make room for new segments.
     Later, if data in a swapped segment must be accessed, it is swapped
     back in, displacing segments which are not currently needed.

     The maximum virtual address space of the Clipper 5.0 VMM is 64MB.
