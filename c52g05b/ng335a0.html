 <B>3   Modifying the Standard Header File (STD.CH)</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In the Getting Started guide as well as in other parts of the
     documentation, it is stated or implied that the standard command
     set used by CLIPPER.EXE to compile Clipper 5.0 programs is defined
     in STD.CH located in the \INCLUDE directory.  This is not quite
     correct.  The standard command set is in fact defined as a part of
     the compiler and never taken directly from STD.CH unless this file
     is specified on the compile command-line with the /U option.  This
     increases the compiling speed of the standard command and function
     set and guarantees that the compiler can always compile the
     standard commands.

     For example, the following compiler invocation command-lines show
     how different configurations of /U can used to use different
     command sets:

     C&gt;CLIPPER Myprog               // Compile with standard command set
     C&gt;CLIPPER Myprog /USTD.CH      // Compile with STD.CH
     C&gt;CLIPPER Myprog /UOTHER.CH    // Compile with OTHER.CH
     C&gt;CLIPPER Myprog /U            // Compile with no command set

     If you are using an alternate command set on a regular basis, you
     might want to add it to your CLIPPERCMD like this:

     C&gt;SET CLIPPERCMD=/UALTSTD.CH
