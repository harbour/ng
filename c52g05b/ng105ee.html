 <B>168 NEW: Objects</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Objects are new in Clipper 5.0.  Objects are instances of classes.
     Classes in turn define the behavior and structure of objects.  In
     Clipper 5.0, there are four built-in classes of objects:

     <B>Table: Clipper 5.0 Classes</B>
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Class        Meaning</B>
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Error        Provides objects containing information about
                  runtime errors
     Get          Provides objects for interactive editing of database
                  fields and memory variables
     TBrowse      Provides objects for browsing table-oriented data
     TBColumn     Provides column objects for TBrowse objects
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Each class has a function (xxxNew()) to create instances of
     the class.  Each class also has a number of exported
     instance variables and methods.  Instance variables
     represent the data structure of the class and methods (like
     functions and procedures) implement the operations an object
     can perform.  Changes in state as well as requests for an
     object to do something are performed by sending the object a
     message using the send (:) operator, as follows:

     <B>&lt;object&gt;:&lt;method&gt;(&lt;arg list&gt;)</B>

     Note that all Clipper 5.0 classes are built-in.  There is no
     way to define your own classes.
