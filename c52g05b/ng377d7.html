 <B>9   Fixed Memory Allocator</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Clipper 5.0 subsystems use virtual memory to contain code or data that
     needs to be dynamically managed.  Some allocations are not appropriate
     for VM (e.g., system tables which must remain in the same location
     throughout execution).  A C-style fixed memory allocator is included
     for this purpose.

     The fixed memory system allocates one or more VM segments and
     permanently locks them in real memory.  Space within these segments is
     then parceled out as needed.  Since fixed segments are never unlocked,
     the VMM locates them at the low end of the swap space to prevent them
     from interfering with other operations.
