 <B>162 CHANGED: Print.prg</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The PrintCodes() function was changed as follows:

     <B>.</B>  Output to the console is suppressed.

     <B>.</B>  The function no longer returns a usable value.

     Note that the latter change is a compatibility issue. Formerly, the
     return value seemed to imply that PrintCodes() would be used like
     this:

     ? "Something" + PrintCodes(CHR(27)) + "Something else"

     This wouldn't have worked before and will definitely not work now.
