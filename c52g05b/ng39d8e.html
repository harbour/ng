 <B>2   Visibility of Locals Referenced in a Code Block</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A local variable referenced in a code block is still visible after
     the declaring function is no longer active as long there is an
     active reference to the code block.  For example:

     bBlock := MyFunc()

     FOR i := 1 TO 10
       ? EVAL( bBlock )
     NEXT
     RETURN

     FUNCTION MyFunc()
       LOCAL nNumber
       LOCAL bBlock

       nNumber := 10
       bBlock := {|| nNumber++}

       RETURN bBlock

     In this example, each time the code block returned by MyFunc() is
     evaluated, it increments nNumber and returns the new value.

     nNumber is accessible via the code block as the function defining
     the code block's activation record becomes <B>detached</B> from the
     activation stack when the function returns.  The function's local
     variables then become, in essence, a free-floating array.  The
     detached activation lives in object memory and stays alive as long
     as any of the blocks referring to it are alive.

     This facility has significant ramifications for the capabilities of
     a code block.  In particular, it solves the problem where a code
     block instance needs long term ownership of some values.  It means,
     generally, that you need to macro-compile a code block only if the
     actual code to be executed isn't known until runtime--not, for
     example, because you wanted the block to always contain or operate
     on a value which isn't known until runtime.

     Note also that every call to the function will generate unique
     instances of the local variables.  If a code block refers to those
     variables, then those variables will continue to exist as long as
     there is a code block that refers to them.
