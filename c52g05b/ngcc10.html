 <B>139 NEW: STATIC</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     STATIC is a new statement that declares variables and arrays that
     have a lifetime of the entire program.

     Variables declared as static may be assigned an initial value as
     part of the STATIC statement using the in-line assignment (:=)
     operator.

     The visibility of a static variable is limited to the declaring
     procedure or function.

     If declared before the first procedure or function declaration in
     a program (.prg) file compiled with the /N option, static variables
     are visible anywhere in the file.  This is referred to as file-wide
     scope.
