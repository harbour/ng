 <B>4   Swap Space</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The term <B>swap space</B> refers to the region of real memory where the
     VMM loads virtual memory segments.

     <B>Configuration:</B>  The VMM allocates the swap space from DOS at
     startup.  By default, all available DOS memory is used for swap space.
     Real memory usage can be restricted using the X setting of the CLIPPER
     environment variable.  The setting specifies an amount of DOS memory
     (in 1K units) which is to be excluded from the VMM.  Valid settings are
     from 0 to 256.  The X setting is provided as a way to reserve DOS
     memory for other uses (e.g., allocation by memory-resident software).
     In general, its use is undesirable because limiting the swap space
     decreases VMM performance.

     <B>Example:</B>  SET CLIPPER=X:8
