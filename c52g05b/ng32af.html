 <B>19  CHANGED: DBEDIT()*</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Instead of having no return value, DBEDIT() now returns NIL.  A
     header file, Dbedit.ch, is provided to make DBEDIT() more
     readable.  DBEDIT(), however, is now classified as a compatibility
     function, and it is recommended that you use the TBrowse object
     class for constructing browse facilities instead.

     There is also an implementation change in DBEDIT().  In Summer '87,
     DBEDIT() knew every record number on the screen.  If the user
     function moved the record pointer to a record that was already on
     the screen, DBEDIT() would change the current row without
     refreshing the window.  If the user function moved the record
     pointer to a record that was not on the screen, DBEDIT() would
     refresh the window.  In 5.0, DBEDIT() no longer knows the numbers
     of all the records in the window.  As a result of this change,
     DBEDIT() refreshes the window whenever the user function changes
     the record pointer, even if the new current record is already on
     the screen.
