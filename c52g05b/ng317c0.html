 <B>5   Why do I get "memory overbooked" when compiling a large (.prg)?</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This message is generated because the program (.prg) files the Clipper
     compiler was attempting to process required more memory than the
     compiler had available.

     This error can occur on programs which contain very large functions or
     procedures (greater than 60K), especially when the compiler is running
     with very little free memory available (for example, when using many
     TSR utilities or executing the compiler from within a text editor).

     The problem can also occur when attempting to compile a monolithic
     application that cascades through many multiple (.prg) files through
     the use of "DO &lt;prgFile&gt;," or when compiling many modules into the same
     .OBJ using a .CLP list.

     In all cases, either the program must be reorganized into smaller units
     or the compiler must be given more memory to run in.

     The preferred solution is to limit individual functions and procedures
     to a reasonable size, group them into reasonably sized source files,
     and compile the files individually using the /M compiler option.  The
     resultant .OBJ files are then presented as a list to .RTLink.  This
     results in better program structure and also gives you the option of
     using the RMAKE utility to avoid unnecessary compilation.  For
     information on compiling, linking, and using RMAKE, refer to your
     Programming and Utilities Guide.
