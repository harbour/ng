 <B>1   Suppressing Snow on CGA Monitors</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     With versions of Clipper prior to 5.0, snow that appeared on some
     CGA monitors could be suppressed using the S argument of the SET
     CLIPPER environment variable.

     In Clipper 5.0, this option has been removed and the function
     NOSNOW() is supplied in its place.  NOSNOW() called with true (.T.)
     as its argument suppresses snow and called with false (.F.) as its
     argument allows snow.  NOSNOW() always returns NIL.
