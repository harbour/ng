 <B>155 NEW: Dict.prg</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is a new sample file that contains functions to model arrays
     as dictionary objects.

     A dictionary is a list of keyed entries where each entry consists
     of a character key and a value of any type.  New keys and values
     can be entered, and existing values can be retrieved based on their
     key.

     Dictionaries are useful if you want to keep a list of keyed values
     without using a database (.dbf) file.  Since they're arrays, you
     can hang onto them with any variable or array element (handy for
     keeping track of multiple cargo items, for example).  If you have
     lots of values, however, a database/index is usually more
     appropriate.
