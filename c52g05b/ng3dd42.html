 <B>12  The _parc() Function</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Extend system's _parc() function is used to access
     character-type parameters passed from Clipper.  It returns a
     pointer to a series of bytes representing the parameter value.

     In order to obtain this pointer, _parc() first locates the
     parameter's VALUE.  If the parameter was a reference to a variable
     (a VREF), _parc() finds the variable first and retrieves the VALUE
     from there.  Otherwise, the VALUE is present on the Eval Stack and
     _parc() can obtain it directly.  Once _parc() has obtained the
     VALUE, it extracts the OREF from it and performs a de-referencing
     operation.  It then places a lock on the virtual memory segment
     containing the character data (preventing it from moving in
     conventional memory) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
     data.

     As noted above, the fact that OREFs are often duplicated when
     character values are assigned, although transparent at the Clipper
     level, can become an issue when _parc() is used.  If a string's
     OREF has been duplicated, it means that the string may be referred
     to by several variables or array elements at the same time.  This
     is why the documentation for _parc() warns that the pointer
     obtained from _parc() should not be used to modify the string
     directly--doing so may have the effect (at the Clipper level) of
     modifying several variables at once.

     Note that Summer '87 also allowed multiple references to the same
     string in certain cases.  Generally, however, when a string was
     assigned to a variable, it was duplicated, giving each variable its
     own copy of the string.  The Summer '87 documentation is not clear
     about the effect of modifying a string via the pointer returned
     from _parc(), saying only that _parc() "does not make a copy" of
     the string.

     In Clipper 5.01, _parc() has been changed to better mimic the
     Summer '87 behavior.  It does this by automatically duplicating the
     string in certain cases.  This change is sufficient to produce
     compatible behavior for many older Extend functions.  For new
     functions, however, you should take the necessary steps to
     guarantee that you are working with a dedicated copy of the
     string.  This can be done using the techniques described in the
     Programming and Utilities Guide or using the new technique
     discussed below.
