 <B>3   Disk Swapping</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     If insufficient EMM is available to contain swapped segments, a
     temporary disk file (the <B>swap file</B>) is created to hold them.
     By default, the VMM will use a maximum of 8MB of disk space for
     the swap file.  Disk space is used only as needed.

     <B>Configuration:</B>  The maximum size of the disk swap file can be
     controlled using the SWAPK setting in the CLIPPER environment
     variable.  Valid settings are from 256 to 64000 (256K to
     64MB).  The SWAPK setting has no effect on VMM swapping
     activity; it merely serves to establish an upper limit on the
     size of the swap file.  If the limit is exceeded, the VMM will
     terminate the application.

     <B>Example:</B>  SET CLIPPER=SWAPK:16000

     <B>Configuration:</B>  The disk drive and directory where the VMM swap
     file is created can be controlled using the SWAPPATH setting in
     the CLIPPER environment variable.  By default, the swap file is
     created in the current DOS directory.

     <B>Example:</B>  SET CLIPPER=SWAPPATH:'C:\SWAP'
