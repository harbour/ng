 <B>163 NEW: Runtime Error System</B>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Runtime Error System has been updated in Clipper 5.0.  The new
     system, still in keeping with Clipper's open architecture
     philosophy, uses the Error object class along with a few
     specialized functions to allow improved runtime error handling.
     The Clipper 5.0 standard error handling system is defined in
     Errorsys.prg as it was in Summer '87; however, the Summer '87 error
     functions (e.g., Db_error(), Undef_error(), Print_error(),
     Expr_error()) are no longer supported and are not supplied as part
     of the 5.0 system.
