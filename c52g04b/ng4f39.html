 <B>Report and Label Utility--(RL.EXE)</B>

 <B>Overview</B>

     Creates and modifies report (.frm) and label (.lbl) files.

     <B>RL</B>

 <B>System Architecture</B>

     The RL system is written in CA-Clipper.  If you installed the default
     configuration of the development environment, the source code is
     located in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\RL directory on the disk where
     CA-Clipper is installed.   RL.EXE is installed in \CLIPPER5\BIN and
     this directory is included in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
     You should, therefore, be able to access RL from any drive and/or
     directory.

     The source files needed that make up the RL system are:

     <B>.</B>  Rlfront.prg
     <B>.</B>  Rllack.prg
     <B>.</B>  Rldialg.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit
     your specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to
     your development environment or simply add the RL system to your
     application thereby giving your users the power to create their own
     reports and labels.

     To facilitate modification, the RL system is broken up into two
     primary subsystems: front and back.  The RL front subsystem (found in
     Rlfront.prg) is the user interface of the entire RL system.  The back
     subsystem (found in Rlback.prg) contains all of the routines for
     reading and writing (.frm) and (.lbl) files.  The system is organized
     in this way so that you can create your own user interface and easily
     access the lower-level routines to read and write the form files.

     If you decide to tailor this system by making changes to the source
     code, a make file, RL.RMK, is located in the same directory as the RL
     source code.  Provided that your changes do not involve additional
     source modules or changes in the existing file dependencies, issuing
     the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C&gt;RMAKE RL

     will compile and link the system to create a new RL.EXE file.  Refer
     to the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in the Programming and
     Utilities guide for more information.
