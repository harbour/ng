 <B>CA-Clipper Program Editor--(PE.EXE)</B>

 <B>Overview</B>

     Creates and edits simple program files.

 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>PE [&lt;filename&gt;]</B>

 <B>Command Line Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> is the name of the text file to edit or create.  The
     default extension is (.prg).  If a filename is not specified, PE
     prompts you for one.

 <B>System Architecture</B>

     Like the DBU and RL utilities, PE is written in CA-Clipper and
     provided in source code form.  If you installed CA-Clipper using the
     default configuration, a single source file named Pe.prg is located
     in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\PE directory.  PE.EXE is installed in
     \CLIPPER5\BIN and this directory is included in the PATH statement in
     your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should, therefore, be able to access PE from
     any drive and/or directory.

     To facilitate maintenance of the PE program file, the make file,
     PE.RMK, is also installed in the PE source directory.  Provided you
     do not add new source files or make changes in the existing file
     dependencies, issuing the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C&gt;RMAKE PE

     will compile and link the PE source files to create a new PE.EXE
     executable file.  See the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in
     Programming and Utilties guide for more information about make files.
