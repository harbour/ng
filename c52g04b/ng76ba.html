 <B>SET CLIPPER</B>
 Runtime configuration of CA-Clipper-compiled programs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Environment Variable:

     <B>SET CLIPPER=</B>
        <B>[//BADCACHE]</B>
        <B>[//CGACURS]</B>
        <B>[//DYNF:&lt;nHandles&gt;]</B>
        <B>[//E:&lt;nExpandedKbytes&gt;]</B>
        <B>[//F:&lt;nHandles&gt;]</B>
        <B>[//INFO]</B>
        <B>[//NOIDLE]</B>
        <B>[//SWAPK:&lt;nBytes&gt;]</B>
        <B>[//SWAPPATH:'&lt;path&gt;']</B>
        <B>[//TEMPPATH:'&lt;path&gt;']</B>
        <B>[//X:&lt;nKbytes&gt;]</B>

     Application Command Line:

     <B>C&gt;&lt;app&gt; [//&lt;setting&gt; ... ] [&lt;app arguments&gt;]</B>

     You should adhere to the following rules when specifying these
     environment settings regardless of whether they are specified on the
     application command line or in the CLIPPER environment variable.

     <B>.</B>  Preface each setting with a double-slash

     <B>.</B>  Place a single blank space between settings

     <B>.</B>  Place a colon between setting and argument with no intervening space

 <B>Description</B>

     CA-Clipper provides runtime configuration control of CA-Clipper-
     compiled programs with a number of settings.  You can specify settings
     in the DOS environment variable CLIPPER or on the command line used to
     invoke an application.  You can enter the CLIPPER variable at the DOS
     prompt or include it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If the user will be
     accessing the application from a network, you can also add the SET
     CLIPPER command to the user's login script.

     Settings that you specify on the application program command line must
     precede application arguments.  If you wish to use the command line
     method instead of the CLIPPER environment variable but want to hide the
     complexity from your end user, use an application batch file to invoke
     the application with the configuration settings.

 <B>Settings</B>

     <B>BADCACHE</B> causes the Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) to preserve and
     restore the state of the EMM page frame before and after every EMM
     access (the EMM page frame is an area in real address space through
     which EMM data is accessed).  This setting can be used to correct
     problems when there are conflicts with other programs that use EMM.

     Note that on some EMM systems, the BADCACHE setting may adversely
     affect VMM performance.  It should only be used if you experience disk
     or file corruption because of a conflict with a disk cache or other
     resident software.

     <B>CGACURS</B> prevents the use of the extended cursor capability of the
     EGA/VGA.  Specifying this setting may preclude some cursor modes by
     some display adaptors.  The CGACURS prevents the cursor weirdness when
     a CA-Clipper program is executed in some multitasking and TSR
     environments.

     <B>DYNF:&lt;nHandles&gt;</B> specifies the number of file handles the dynamic
     overlay system is allowed to use.  Valid settings range from 1 to 8
     inclusive.  If not specified, the default is 2.

     <B>E:&lt;nExpandedKbytes&gt;</B> restricts the amount of expanded memory
     automatically allocated to &lt;nExpandedKbytes&gt;.  CA-Clipper-compiled and
     linked programs can use expanded memory to speed up processing as well
     as some disk-based operations.  CA-Clipper can use memory configured
     as expanded memory according to the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft (LIM)
     Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) version 4.0 or higher.

     Expanded memory is automatically allocated in its entirety at startup;
     there is no dynamic allocation as execution proceeds.  The maximum
     amount allocated is limited by four factors:

     <B>.</B>  The amount available
     <B>.</B>  The SET CLIPPER=//E:nnn environment setting
     <B>.</B>  A theoretical maximum of 32MB
     <B>.</B>  The amount of conventional memory available

     Note that a certain amount of conventional memory must be used to
     contain management tables for the virtual memory system--the more total
     memory (both conventional and expanded), the more space taken up by
     this control information.  The amount of expanded memory used may be
     less than the amount available if there is insufficient conventional
     memory to hold the tables.

     <B>F:&lt;nHandles&gt;</B> is used in combination with the value specified with
     the FILES command in CONFIG.SYS to inform CA-Clipper of the maximum
     number of file handles to use.  This setting is only valid for
     application programs using more than 20 files and running under DOS
     3.3 or greater.  When specified, CA-Clipper determines the number of
     files that can be opened using the smaller of the F setting and the
     CONFIG.SYS FILES value.  For example, if the FILES command is set to
     120 and the F parameter is set to 50, the maximum number of files that
     can be opened is 50.  The ideal &lt;nHandles&gt; is an odd number and 5 less
     than specified with the FILES command.

     <B>INFO</B> Provides the following information about CA-Clipper's memory
     usage at startup of an application.

     <B>.</B>  The first line describes the general product version, revision,
        and international version.

     <B>.</B>  DS=&lt;offset&gt;:0000 is the address for the data segment or DGROUP.

     <B>.</B>  DS avail=&lt;memory&gt;KB reflects the amount of DGROUP available.

     <B>.</B>  OS avail=&lt;memory&gt;KB represents the amount of conventional
        memory available for VMM swap space.

     <B>.</B>  EMM avail=&lt;EMM memory&gt;KB shows the amount of EMM (expanded
        memory) allocated to the current application.

     <B>.</B>  Fixed Heap=&lt;fixed heap&gt;KB/&lt;number of fixed segments&gt; shows the
        size of the fixed heap in kilobyte increments in addition to the
        number of fixed segments.

     <B>NOIDLE</B> prevents CA-Clipper from detecting and taking advantage of idle
     time during execution of compiled applications.  CA-Clipper detects
     idle states (e.g. keyboard wait states) during execution of compiled
     applications.  When an idle condition is detected, the system uses the
     slack time to perform garbage collection, file updates, and other
     routine housekeeping duties.  This increases system performance by
     performing this work while the application is waiting for user input.

     <B>Note: </B>NOIDLE is provided for applications in which idle time processing
     is unacceptable.  Since it reduces overall system performance, its use
     is generally not recommended.

     <B>SWAPK:&lt;nBytes&gt;</B> specifies the maximum allowable size of the disk
     swap file used for the virtual memory (VM) system.  Settings are
     specified in kilobyte increments.  Valid settings range from 256 to
     65,535 inclusive.  If this setting is not specified, the default is
     16,384 (16 MB).

     <B>Note: </B>Swap space is only allocated as needed--a particular setting
     does not guarantee that the swap file will get that big.  Suppressing or
     restricting disk swapping may cause an application to fail.

     <B>SWAPPATH:'&lt;path&gt;'</B> specifies the location of the virtual memory swap
     file.  If not specified, the swap file is created in the current DOS
     drive and directory.

     <B>TEMPPATH:'&lt;path&gt;'</B> controls the placement of temporary files created
     during sorting and indexing.  By default these files are placed in
     the current DOS directory.

     <B>Note: </B>Temporary files created during sorting and indexing can be quite
     large.  Setting TEMPPATH to a small volume (e.g. a ram disk) may cause
     these operations to fail.  In general, the volume where these temporary
     files will be written should have an available capacity at least twice
     the size of the largest index to be created or database file to be
     sorted.

     <B>X:&lt;nKbytes&gt;</B> specifies the amount of memory to exclude from being
     allocated, except for the RUN command.  Specified in kilobytes, valid
     values range from zero to 64 inclusive.  If not specified, the default
     value is zero.

 <B>Examples</B>

     This example shows a series of settings using the CA-Clipper
     environment variable:

     SET CLIPPER=//F:50 //DYNF:4 //SWAPK:4096 //NOIDLE

     This example shows how the same settings can be used on the
     application's command line:

     C&gt;ACCOUNTS //F:50 //DYNF:4 //SWAPK:4096 //NOIDLE
