 <B>The CA-Clipper Debugger--(CLD.EXE)</B>

 <B>Overview</B>

     Allows you to debug your source code while your executable file is
     running.

 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CLD [[/43 | /50 | /S] [@&lt;scriptFile&gt;]</B>
     <B>   &lt;exeFile&gt; [&lt;argument list&gt;]]</B>

 <B>Command Line Arguments</B>

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the Debugger.  If issued
     without any arguments, a brief help screen is displayed.

     <B>/43</B> specifies 43 line mode and is available on EGA and VGA monitors.

     <B>/50</B> specifies 50 line mode and is available on VGA monitors only.

     <B>/S</B> is available on EGA and VGA monitors only.  This option splits
     the screen between your application and the Debugger, allowing you to
     view the application and the Debugger simultaneously.  On a VGA monitor
     /S uses 50 line mode, and on an EGA monitor it uses 43 line mode. In
     split screen mode, the top 25 lines of the screen are used by your
     application, and the remaining lines are used for the Debugger display.

     <B>&lt;scriptFile&gt;</B> is the name of a script file with a default extension
     of (.cld).  CLD searches for the specified &lt;scriptFile&gt; in the current
     directory and then searches the DOS PATH.  A script file is simply an
     ASCII text file containing one or more Debugger commands, with each
     command appearing on a separate line.  When the Debugger is invoked with
     a script file, each command in the file is executed automatically after
     the &lt;exeFile&gt; file is loaded.

     In addition to any script file called for on the CLD command line, the
     Debugger automatically searches for a script file with the name
     Init.cld.  If a file by this name is located in the current directory or
     anywhere in the DOS PATH, the Debugger executes it as a script file.  If
     both Init.cld and a command line script file are present, Init.cld is
     executed first followed by the command line script file.

     <B>&lt;exeFile&gt;</B> is the name of the executable file (.EXE) you want to
     debug.  CLD searches for the &lt;exeFile&gt; in the current directory only--
     the DOS PATH is not searched.  If this file has not been compiled using
     the /B compiler option to embed debugging information, debugging is not
     possible.

     <B>&lt;argument list&gt;</B> is the argument list for &lt;exeFile&gt;.  There must be a
     space between &lt;argument list&gt; and &lt;exeFile&gt;.
