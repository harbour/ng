 <B>Database Utility--(DBU.EXE)</B>

 <B>Overview</B>

     Creates and modifies database structures; performs simple data
     management tasks.

 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DBU [/&lt;colorString&gt;] [&lt;filename&gt;] /e</B>

 <B>Command Line Arguments</B>

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the CA-Clipper database
     utility.  If issued without any arguments, the main DBU screen is
     displayed from which you can open files and access the menu bar.

     <B>&lt;colorString&gt;</B> is /C for color and /M for monochrome.

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> is the name of a view file (.vew) previously created in
     DBU or a database file (.dbf).  Specifying this argument causes DBU to
     open and browse the specified file.

     Specifying <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> on the DBU command line causes the named file
     to be opened and browsed after DBU is loaded.

     <B>/e</B> opens the file EXCLUSIVE.  This parameter is case-insensitive.

 <B>System Architecture</B>

     DBU is an application that is written entirely in CA-Clipper.  If you
     installed the default configuration of the development environment, the
     source code is located in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\DBU directory on the
     disk where CA-Clipper is installed.   DBU.EXE and DBU.HLP are
     installed in \CLIPPER5\BIN and this directory is included in the PATH
     statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  You should, therefore, be able to
     access DBU from any drive and/or directory.

     The source files needed that make up the DBU system are:

     <B>.</B>  Dbu.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbu.hlp
     <B>.</B>  Dbucopy.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuedit.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuhelp.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuindx.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbunet.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbustru.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuutil.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuview.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit your
     specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to your
     development environment or add the DBU system to your application
     thereby giving your users the power to create their own views.

     If you decide to tailor this system by making changes to the source
     code, a make file called DBU.RMK is located in the same directory as
     the DBU source code.  Provided that your changes do not involve
     additional source modules or changes in the existing file dependencies,
     issuing the following command at the DOS prompt:

     C&gt;RMAKE DBU

     will compile and link the system to create a new DBU.EXE file.  Refer
     to the Program Maintenance--RMAKE.EXE chapter in the Programming and
     Utiltites guide for more information on make files.
