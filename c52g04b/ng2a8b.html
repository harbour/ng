 <B>Program Maintenance--(RMAKE.EXE)</B>

 <B>Overview</B>

     Automates the maintenance of multi-file program systems by keeping files
     up to date.  It does this by comparing the date and time stamps of files
     related to one another and performs a series of actions if the date and
     time stamps do not match.

 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>RMAKE [&lt;makeFile list&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;macroDef list&gt;] [&lt;option list&gt;]</B>

 <B>Command Line Arguments</B>

     This is the command line syntax to invoke the CA-Clipper make utility.
     If issued without any arguments, a help screen is displayed.

     <B>&lt;makeFile list&gt;</B> is a list of one or more make files to process.  The
     default extension for this file is (.RMK).

     <B>&lt;macroDef list&gt;</B> is a list of one or more macro definitions of the
     form &lt;macroName&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.

     <B>&lt;option list&gt;</B> is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the make, all of which are described below.

 <B>RMAKE Options</B>

     <B>/B</B>

     Displays debugging information.

     <B>/D&lt;macroName&gt;[:&lt;value&gt;]</B>

     Defines a macro and an optional value.  If the value is not supplied,
     the macro is defined with a null value.

     <B>/I</B>

     Ignores execution errors.

     <B>/N</B>

     Performs a null make displaying the commands that would be executed
     without actually executing them.

     <B>/S</B>

     Searches subdirectories for make files.

     <B>/U</B>

     Enables the # character as a comment indicator and suppresses its use as
     a directive indicator.

     <B>/W</B>

     Displays certain warning messages.

     <B>/XS&lt;numSymbols&gt;</B>

     Sets the size of the internal symbol table.  If not specified, the
     default is 500 symbols.

     <B>/XW&lt;numBytes&gt;</B>

     Sets the size of the internal workspace.  If not specified, the default
     is 2048 bytes.

 <B>Comments</B>

     Comments may be specified using C-style inline comments (e.g. /* .. */ )
     or C-style line comments (//) or, if the /U option is used, Unix make-
     style comments (#).  Comments cannot be nested.

 <B>Dependency Rules</B>

     A dependency rule causes certain actions to be performed if any of the
     dependent files have a newer date and time stamp than the target file:

     <B>&lt;targetFile&gt;: &lt;dependentFile list&gt;</B>
     <B>   [&lt;action&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;action&gt;]...</B>

 <B>Inference Rules</B>

     An inference rule is used to complete a dependency rule specified with
     no actions.  It defines the actions to take for any incomplete
     dependency rule that satisfies certain filename extensions:

     <B>.&lt;dependentExtension&gt;.&lt;targetExtension&gt;:</B>
     <B>   [&lt;action&gt;]</B>
     <B>   [&lt;action&gt;]...</B>

 <B>Macro Definitions</B>

     Macros are defined in make files using the following syntax:

     <B>&lt;macroName&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</B>

     Once defined, a macro can be referred to using the following syntax:

     <B>$(&lt;macroName&gt;)</B>

     To assign the contents of a macro to another macro, use the following
     syntax:

     <B>&lt;macroName&gt; := $(&lt;macroName&gt;)</B>

 <B>Makepath Macros</B>

     Makepath macros are special macros that define where RMAKE searches and
     creates classes of files as defined by extension.  Makepath macros are
     defined using the following syntax:

     <B>makepath[.&lt;extension&gt;] = &lt;pathSpec&gt;</B>

 <B>Predefined Macros</B>

     In addition to user-defined macros, there are several predefined macros
     that can be used to access dependency and target filenames.

     <B>$*</B>

     Expands to the target filename without a path or extension.

     <B>$@</B>

     Expands to the target filename including path and extension.

     <B>$**</B>

     Expands to the complete list of full dependency filenames.

     <B>$&lt;</B>

     Expands to the full name of the first file in the dependent file list.

     <B>$?</B>

     Expands to a list of dependencies that have a more recent date and time
     stamp than the target file.

 <B>Directives</B>

     RMAKE provides directives to control the operation of the make process.
     Directives cannot be used as action lines.  Macros encountered in a
     directive are expanded immediately.  By default, either the # character
     or the ! character can be used to specify a directive. If the /U option
     is used, the # character is interpreted as a comment indicator, and
     cannot be used to specify directives.

     <B>#! &lt;action&gt;</B>

     Execute a DOS command.

     <B>#else</B>

     Executes statements between the #else and the next #endif directive when
     the corresponding #if directive evaluates to false (.F.).

     <B>#end[if]</B>

     Terminates the block of statements defined by a #if directive.

     <B>#ifdef &lt;macroName&gt;</B>

     Executes statements between the #ifdef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified &lt;macroName&gt; exists.

     <B>#ifeq &lt;word1&gt; &lt;word2&gt;</B>

     Executes statements between the #ifeq directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if &lt;word1&gt; and &lt;word2&gt; are identical.  A word
     consists of one or more characters up to the next white space character.
     To include a white space character within a word, enclose the word in
     double-quote (") marks.

     <B>#iffile &lt;fileSpec&gt;</B>

     Executes statements between the #iffile directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if any files match the specified &lt;fileSpec&gt;.

     <B>#ifndef &lt;macroName&gt;</B>

     Executes statements between the #ifndef directive and the corresponding
     #else or #endif directives if the specified &lt;macroName&gt; does not exist.

     <B>#include .&lt;fileName&gt;.</B>

     Inserts and processes the contents of &lt;fileName&gt; before continuing with
     the current make file.

     <B>#stderr "&lt;text&gt;"</B>

     Writes the &lt;text&gt; to the standard error file or device.

     <B>#stdout "&lt;text&gt;"</B>

     Writes the &lt;text&gt; to the standard output file or device.

     <B>#undef &lt;macroName&gt;</B>

     Removes any previous definition of the specified &lt;macroName&gt;.
