  <B>Scalar Classes</B>

  Class(y) now treats standard Clipper data types as though they were
  objects. Each data type corresponds to a class. The class names are the
  same as those used in the <B>TYPE</B> clause of the <B>VAR</B> command, with the
  addition of Nil - Array, Block, Character, Date, Integer, Logical, Nil,
  and Numeric.

  Strictly speaking, the term <B>scalar</B> refers to a value that has
  magnitude but no other attributes. The term is stretched slightly here
  when applied to character strings, code blocks and even dates. However,
  with the exception of arrays, from a programming standpoint the built-in
  data types are all scalar-like in that they consist of a single value. We
  will therefore use the terms <B>scalar values</B> and <B>scalar classes</B> to
  refer to Clipper data values and data types other than arrays.

  The Array class is nevertheless dealt with here, since its definition
  follows most of the rules for defining scalar classes.

  Source code to the Array class is provided. Many of the methods defined in
  the Array class are used by the Class(y) kernel. The Array class can be
  extended and even subclassed, and other scalar classes can be user-
  defined. More information can be found in the files CSYARRAY.PRG and
  ARRSIZE.PRG. Default scalar classes other than Array are automatically
  created by Class(y) if they are not supplied by the user.

  To define one of these scalar classes, a command such as the following
  should be used:

    CREATE CLASS Character ;
       FROM ScalarObject FUNCTION csyCharacter

  All scalar classes except Array must inherit from the ScalarObject class,
  as shown above.

  Since some of the classnames used by Clipper, such as ARRAY, are also the
  names of Clipper functions, a <B>FUNCTION</B> clause has been used above to
  define a class with a name different from that of its class function. This
  clause <U>must</U> be included when defining a scalar class, and the
  specified function name must consist of the letters CSY prepended to the
  one of the abovementioned scalar class names. It is this function name
  that Class(y) uses to detect user-supplied scalar classes.

  The scalar classes can clean up code quite a bit; for example, now, you
  can have statements like:

    IF obj:isKindOf( Window() )

  instead of:

    IF obj != NIL .AND. obj:isKindOf( Window() )

  The reason is that the NIL class is a subclass of Object and supports the
  isKindOf message, just like any other class. This sort of thing happens
  quite often in most code, in one form or another.

  Another example is using <U>eval</U>; you can now use:

    block:eval(...)

  instead of:

    IF block != NIL
       EVAL(block, ...)
    END

  This works because <U>eval</U> (and <U>exec</U>) have been defined in the Object
  class as null methods; sending them to NIL will do nothing.

  The <U>deepCopy</U> method in the Object class provides another example of
  this. For each element of an array/object, it executes:

    newObj[i] := self[i]:copy()

  No matter what type of value is stored in self[i], the above code will
  work, because even data such as numbers and strings will respond correctly
  to the <U>copy</U> message (this behavior for scalar data is defined in the
  ScalarObject class).

  It is also straightforward to cause objects of all types, including
  scalars, to respond to standard messages such as <U>size</U>. For example:

    CREATE CLASS Date FROM ScalarObject FUNCTION csyDate
    EXPORT:
       METHOD size
    END CLASS

    METHOD size
    RETURN 8

  By default, Class(y) supports the <U>size</U> message when sent to arrays and
  strings. Behavior of other scalar classes is user-definable.
