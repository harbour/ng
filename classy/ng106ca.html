  <B>Enhanced Object Inspector</B>

  Class(y) 2.4 provides an Enhanced Object Inspector which replaces the
  Clipper debugger's default object inspector, providing a greatly enhanced
  view of your objects.

  To use it, link the library CSYINSP.LIB into your application (note that
  the entire library can be overlaid). Since no functions in the library are
  called directly, it is best to link the entire library into your
  application, eg:

    RTLINK FI MYAPP, CSYINSP.LIB LIB CLASSY

  Then enter the debugger and examine your objects as normal.

  Three columns are displayed. The second and third columns display the name
  and value, respectively, of each of the object's variables. The first
  column shows the class in which that variable was defined. All variables,
  including variables inherited from superclasses, are displayed.

  Values can be edited in the same way as values in Clipper's default object
  inspector. Pressing ENTER on the value field will begin editing.

  You can find out more about a variable or message, such as its scope, by
  selecting and pressing ENTER on a message in the second column. This has
  the effect of displaying the internal Class(y) object which refers to that
  message or variable. The instance variable scopeDesc specifies the scope
  of the item. Other data, such as class or type restrictions on instance
  variables, are also displayed.

  Class objects can also be examined by pressing ENTER in the first column.

  If you don't link an application with CSYINSP.LIB, the standard
  Clipper/Class(y) object inspector, described in the following section, is
  used.
