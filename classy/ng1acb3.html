  <B>Multiple Inheritance</B>

  The CREATE CLASS command can be used to create multiply inherited classes,
  as follows:

    CREATE CLASS &lt;className&gt; ;
       FROM &lt;parentClass1&gt;, &lt;parentClass2&gt; [, ...]

  To implement multiple inheritance correctly, Class(y) examines the
  ancestor classes of a multiply inherited class, and determines a single
  path through the ancestor tree. This affects which messages take
  precedence in the final class. It allows <B>repeated inheritance</B>, in
  which the same class occurs repeatedly in the ancestor tree. Class(y)
  treats repeatedly inherited classes as a single class. A diagram should
  help to explain this:

            Object
             |
             Box
             |
           Window
          /     \
    TextWindow   BorderedWindow
           \    /
         BordTextWindow

  The class BordTextWindow is multiply inherited from TextWindow and
  BorderedWindow. Assume that the BordTextWindow class was created with the
  following statement:

    CREATE CLASS BordTextWindow FROM TextWindow, BorderedWindow

  Class(y) will search for messages in the classes in the following
  sequence:

    BordTextWindow, TextWindow, BorderedWindow, Window, Box, Object

  Although the Window class is inherited from both branches of the tree, it
  is treated as a single class, ie. you do not end up with two sets of
  Window instance variables in the resulting class.

  The algorithm for determining a single path through the inheritance tree
  uses two rules (see Booch pg. 113):

  <B>.</B>  A class always has precedence over its superclass; ie. a superclass is
     never searched before any of its subclasses present in the ancestor
     tree of a multiply inherited class.

  <B>.</B>  Each class sets the precedence order of its direct superclasses.
