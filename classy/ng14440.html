  <B>Message Forwarding</B>

  Methods of the following form occur quite often in most programs:

    METHOD foo( &lt;params,...&gt; )
    RETURN ::someObj:foo( &lt;params&gt; )

  Such methods can easily be replaced by a class declaration command such
  as:

    MESSAGE foo TO someObj

  This eliminates the need to define a method.

  Both of the above cases are examples of message forwarding. The latter
  example, using the <B>MESSAGE...TO</B> command, is merely a more automatic
  and efficient version of the former. As this example shows, message
  forwarding can and should be used when all a method is doing is forwarding
  a message on to a component object. Automatic message forwarding is simple
  to implement, it saves code, executes faster, and can clarify the
  relationship between a class and its component objects. Rather than having
  to examine the methods of a class to determine its relationship to its
  components, the class specification clearly identifies these
  relationships, improving readability and allowing easier maintenance.

  See the <B>MESSAGE...[IS...] TO</B> command for more information and examples
  of defining forwarded messages.

  Message forwarding is also used when implementing <B>delegation</B>. See
  <B>Delegation</B> under <B>Advanced Topics</B> for more information.
