 <B>METHOD (declaration)</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Declare method(s) with same named message(s)
         (inside class specification)

 <B>Syntax</B>

         METHOD &lt;method name list&gt; [CONSTRUCTOR | CTOR]

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;method name list&gt;</B> is a list of methods to be declared. Each
         such method should be defined later in the same module using the
         <B>METHOD definition</B> command.

 <B>Description</B>

         This command is used within a class specification to declare one
         or more methods for that class. Once a method has been declared
         using this command, the actual code of the method must be defined
         using the <B>METHOD definition</B> command (see next entry).

         Methods declared and defined in this way can be invoked by sending
         a message of the same name as the method to an instance of the
         class.

         With Class(y), the name of a message and the name of the
         associated method is usually the same, and the <B>METHOD</B> command
         assumes this. See the <B>MESSAGE...METHOD</B> command for information
         about declaring messages whose methods have a different name.

         It is strongly recommended that methods declared using this syntax
         are defined in the same program module as the class specification.
         See the section <B>External Methods</B> for alternatives.

         If the optional <B>CONSTRUCTOR</B> clause is included (or its
         abbreviation <B>CTOR</B>), then the message is flagged as a
         constructor message. See <B>Constructor Messages</B> for more
         information.

 <B>Note</B>

         This form of the <B>METHOD</B> command is referred to as a <B>method</B>
         <B>declaration</B> command, and is only valid inside a class
         specification. After the class specification, the <B>METHOD</B>
         command is treated as a <B>method definition</B> command (described
         in the following entry).
