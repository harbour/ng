  <B>Class Methods</B>

  Class methods are declared using the <B>CLASS METHOD</B> command.

  A class method is a method which operates on an entire class (or a subset
  of a class), rather than on a single instance of that class. Any operation
  which deals with more than one instance of a class is a good candidate for
  a class method.

  In a class method, the <U>self</U> variable refers to the class object for
  that class. This means that class methods can access class variables
  directly. For example, in the previous section, the expression:

    ::class:currSelected

  was used to access the class variable <U>currSelected</U>. In a class method,
  we would instead use <U>::currSelected</U> to access the variable.

  If a regular method is accessing class variables and methods repeatedly,
  it is worth exploring whether that aspect of its operation can be
  extracted and made into a class method. It is more efficient to access
  class variables from within a class method. Also, it often makes better
  sense from a conceptual design perspective to encapsulate, within a class
  method, code which repeatedly uses class messages.
