 <B>CREATE CLASS</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Begin a class specification

 <B>Syntax</B>

         CREATE CLASS &lt;class name&gt;
              [INHERIT &lt;superclass name&gt;]
              [METACLASS &lt;metaclass name&gt;]
              [STATIC][FUNCTION &lt;function name&gt;]

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;class name&gt;</B> is the name of the class to be created. This name
         follows the same rules as those governing Clipper function names.

         <B>&lt;superclass name&gt;</B> is the name of the class from which the new
         class should be inherited. If omitted, the new class will have the
         superclass <B>Object</B> (the default superclass of all classes). If
         more than one class is specified (separated by commas), a multiply-
         inherited class is created. See the section on <B>Multiple</B>
         <B>Inheritance</B>.

         <B>&lt;metaclass name&gt;</B> is the name of the metaclass which should be
         used to instantiate this class. This is an advanced feature which
         is not necessary in normal programming. See the section on
         <B>Metaclasses</B> for more information.

         <B>STATIC</B> specifies that the <B>class function</B> for this class
         will be declared as a static function, thus will not be accessible
         outside the current module.

         <B>FUNCTION &lt;function name&gt;</B> specifies a name for the <B>class</B>
         <B>function</B> which is different from the class name.

 <B>Description</B>

         Begins a class specification. A class specification is a sequence
         of Class(y) commands, beginning with <B>CREATE CLASS</B> and ending
         with <B>END CLASS</B>, which constitute the structure of a given
         class, ie. the names of all variables, messages and methods
         contained in that class.

         Class members (variables, messages and methods) declared after a
         <B>CREATE CLASS</B> command are considered hidden by default. This
         means that they cannot be accessed outside the methods of their
         class (see the <B>HIDDEN:</B> command). The <B>EXPORT:</B> and
         <B>PROTECTED:</B> commands can be used to achieve a visibility other
         than the default.

         All of the commands defined in this chapter can be used after
         <B>CREATE CLASS</B> to specify the structure of a class. Some of the
         most commonly used commands are:

              <B>VAR</B>
              <B>METHOD</B>
              <B>MESSAGE...METHOD</B>
              <B>CLASS VAR</B>
              <B>CLASS METHOD</B>
              <B>CLASS MESSAGE...METHOD</B>
              <B>EXPORT:</B>
              <B>PROTECTED:</B>
              <B>HIDDEN:</B>

         These commands are collectively referred to as class declaration
         commands. Refer to their individual entries for more information.

         Once the desired class structure has been declared using these
         commands, <B>END CLASS</B> is used to end the class specification.

         After the <B>END CLASS</B> command has appeared, the <B>METHOD</B>
         <B>definition</B> command can be used to define the methods which
         were declared in the class specification.

 <B>Example</B>

         A complete definition of a simple Box class follows. The class
         specification declares four instance variables and two methods.
         The methods are defined after the class specification.

           #include "class(y).ch"

           CREATE CLASS Box
              VAR top, left, bottom, right
           EXPORT:
              METHOD init
              METHOD draw
           END CLASS

           METHOD init( nTop, nLeft, nBottom, nRight )
              ::top    := nTop
              ::left   := nLeft
              ::bottom := nBottom
              ::right  := nRight
           RETURN self

           METHOD draw()
              DispBox(::top, ::left, ::bottom, ::right)
           RETURN self

 <B>Notes</B>

         It is best to define only one class per module (single .PRG file).
         This is to avoid problems in distinguishing between methods of the
         same name, such as <U>init</U>, which most classes implement.

         The <B>CREATE CLASS</B> command actually generates a Clipper function
         with the same name as the class. This is explained further under
         the <B>Class Functions </B>and<B> Class Objects</B> sections.
