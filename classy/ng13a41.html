  <B>Link Sequence</B>

  The sequence in which CLASSY.LIB is linked can be important. CLASSY.LIB
  should usually come before CLIPPER.LIB in the link sequence, if
  CLIPPER.LIB is explicitly specified. Also, if products based on the
  Class(y) runtime version are used, CLASSY.LIB must usually be linked
  before the library containing the runtime version. However, the exact link
  sequence may depend on the combination of libraries being used. If
  Class(y) detects that it has been linked incorrectly, it will terminate
  the application with an error message.
