 <B>MESSAGE...METHOD</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Declare message and corresponding method

 <B>Syntax</B>

         MESSAGE &lt;message name&gt; METHOD &lt;method name&gt;
              [CONSTRUCTOR | CTOR]

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;message name&gt;</B> is the name of the message being declared. Like
         a Clipper function or variable name, up to 10 characters are
         significant. Extra characters will be ignored.

         <B>&lt;method name&gt;</B> is the name of the method to invoke when the
         specified message is sent. A method of this name should be defined
         later in the same module using the <B>METHOD definition</B> command,
         unless an <B>external method</B> is being declared.

 <B>Description</B>

         This command allows a method to be declared which is invoked by a
         message with a name different from that of the method. This may be
         necessary for one of several reasons:

 1.      The message name conflicts with a Clipper reserved name. Examples
         of this are <U>left</U>, <U>delete</U>, and <U>at</U> (see the Clipper
         documentation section on reserved words). These are names which
         the Clipper compiler handles specially, so having methods with the
         same names is problematic. However, this does not prevent the use
         of these names as messages. To map a message to a method with a
         different name, a statement such as the following can be used:

              MESSAGE left METHOD boxLeft

         In this example, the message <U>left</U> is mapped to the method
         called <U>boxLeft</U>.

 2.      When an ordinary function is called which has the same name as the
         method from which it is being called. For example, attempting to
         call a function called <U>Display()</U> from a method called
         <U>display</U> will result in an endless recursive loop. To resolve
         this, give the method a different name, for example:

              MESSAGE display METHOD boxDisplay

         This maps the display message to a method called <U>boxDisplay</U>.
         Now if a function called <U>Display()</U> is called from within the
         <U>boxDisplay</U> method, everything works as expected.

 3.      To map a message to a method which is defined in a module other
         than the one containing the class specification. This is not
         recommended practice. See <B>External Methods</B>.

 4.      To map two or more messages in a class to the same method. This
         might be required to support an obsolete message which is still in
         use. For example:

              MESSAGE getValue METHOD get
              METHOD  get

         In this case, the messages <U>getValue</U> and <U>get</U> both map to
         the same method, named <U>get</U>. Note that the second statement
         above uses the default behaviour of the <B>METHOD</B> command to name
         a message and method the same name - it would be unnecessary
         (although it would work) to use <U>MESSAGE get</U> <U>METHOD get</U>.

 <B>Note</B>

         If the optional <B>CONSTRUCTOR</B> clause is included (or its
         abbreviation <B>CTOR</B>), then the message is flagged as a
         constructor message. See <B>Constructor Messages</B> <B>and Methods</B>
         for more information.
