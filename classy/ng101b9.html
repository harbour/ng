  <B>Instantiation and Performance</B>

  Creating new objects (instantiation) in Class(y) is a relatively fast
  operation. However, other factors, such as class creation, can make it
  seem slower than it really is.

  When the first object in a system is created, Class(y) initializes itself
  by creating various system classes and performing other internal
  operations. You can force Class(y) to initialize itself before any objects
  are created, by including a call to a function called Class(). This will
  initialize Class(y).

  Whenever any class is used for the first time, that class must first be
  created. Each class is created only once during the execution of an
  application. To force a class to be created before any objects of that
  class are created, the <B>class function</B> for that class should be called.
  For example, if an application includes a class called InvItem, the class
  can be created by calling the InvItem() function during initialization of
  the application.

  Creating a class in this way will also have the side effect of
  initializing Class(y), eliminating the need for an explicit call to
  Class().

  Other factors which may affect performance are discussed under
  <B>Performance</B>.
