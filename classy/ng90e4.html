 <B>VAR...[IS...] IN</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Control multiply inherited variables

 <B>Syntax</B>

         VAR &lt;variable name&gt; [IS &lt;original name&gt;]
              IN &lt;ancestor class&gt;

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;variable name&gt;</B> is the name that the variable will have in the
         current class.

         <B>&lt;original name&gt;</B> is the name of an inherited variable (a
         variable defined in an ancestor class) which the declared variable
         will be mapped to. This argument should be omitted if its value is
         the same as <B>&lt;variable name&gt;</B>.

         <B>&lt;ancestor class&gt;</B> is the name of the class which contains the
         original message. This argument is only required in multiply
         inherited classes.

 <B>Description</B>

         If a multiply inherited class inherits a variable with the same
         name from two different classes, one will always override the
         other. This command can be used to specify that such a variable
         should be inherited from a class other than the default, or given
         a different name in the subclass being defined.

         Specifying a class other than the default from which to inherit a
         variable is probably only useful if the variable has been defined
         with qualifications, such as a <B>TYPE</B> or <B>CLASS</B> restriction.

         Specifying an alternative name for a multiply inherited variable
         will only help to resolve name conflicts if the variable is not
         used in an ancestor class.

 <B>Example</B>

         Assume that a class named BordTextWindow is multiply inherited
         from two classes named BorderedWindow and TextWindow as follows:

           CREATE CLASS BorderedTextWindow ;
                 FROM TextWindow, BorderedWindow
              // ...

         By default, because it is listed first, variables inherited from
         TextWindow will take precedence over variables of the same name
         inherited from BorderedWindow. We can override the default
         precedence as follows:

           VAR x IN BorderedWindow

         Assuming TextWindow also has a variable named x, the above
         declaration will cause it to be overridden by the one inherited
         from BorderedWindow. However, this does not necessarily solve all
         problems caused by name conflicts. See the warning below for more
         information.

         In our example so far, special action (use of a scope resolution
         message) would be required to access the x variable inherited from
         TextWindow. To resolve this, we could define an alternative name
         for x in the TextWindow class:

           VAR x IN BorderedWindow  // as above
           VAR textX IS x IN TextWindow

         This provides a convenient way to access both methods. Of course,
         we could have achieved something similar the other way around:

           MESSAGE bordX IS x IN BorderedWindow

         This relies on the fact the default x would be inherited from
         TextWindow, and defines an alternative name (bordX) for the other
         x variable, inherited from BorderedWindow.

 <B>Warning</B>

         In the first part of the example above, x was defined so that it
         would refer to the x variable defined in BorderedWindow, instead
         of the one defined in TextWindow. However, this can lead to a
         problem if x is used in any of the methods defined in TextWindow,
         or other ancestor classes. When these variables are accessed via
         an instance of BordTextWindow, the variable defined in
         BorderedWindow will be accessed. This is unlikely to be the
         behavior expected by the methods in TextWindow, and usually leads
         to serious problems.

         For this reason, it is best to use the <B>VAR...[IS...] IN</B>
         command to redefine variables which are not used in the class in
         which they are originally defined. See <B>Multiple Inheritance</B>
         for more information.
