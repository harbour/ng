  <B>Inheriting From GET</B>

  Inheriting from Clipper's GET class presents some special problems for
  Class(y). When a GET object receives or loses focus, its internal
  structure is rearranged by Clipper. This rearrangement does not take
  subclasses into account, since Clipper 5.01 is not designed to support
  inheritance. As a result, variables defined in subclasses of GET would be
  deleted or otherwise corrupted, if Class(y) did not take special action to
  prevent this.

  Class(y) uses the cargo variable in each GET object to hold subclass
  instance variables. The cargo variable thus cannot be used for other
  purposes, unless it is redefined.

  If a GET subclass or its client application wishes to make use of cargo,
  the variable should be redefined in the first-level subclass of GET, as in
  the following example:

    CREATE CLASS MemoGet FROM Get
       VAR cargo
       // ...

  The VAR cargo declaration in the MemoGet class redefines the cargo
  variable so that it can be used by clients of MemoGet.

  If your classes will be used by other people, it is best to redefine cargo
  in this way, so that full compatibility with the published specification
  for the GET class is maintained.

  <B>Performance Note</B>

  Because of the way in which inheritance from GET has been implemented,
  access to instance variables in subclasses of GET is slower than it is for
  other classes. In most cases, this is not noticeable. However, it can
  become a problem with large or complex subclasses of GET. If that is the
  case, a possible alternative to subclassing GET is to design a wrapper
  class which contains a GET object as one of its instance variables, and
  delegates all GET messages to that object. Of course, the performance gain
  obtained by not subclassing GET may be cancelled by the overhead of
  delegating all of GET's messages. The best solution depends on the
  requirements of the application.
