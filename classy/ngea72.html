  <B>Creating New Objects</B>

  New objects are usually created by sending the <U>new()</U> message to a
  class object. For example, to create a new instance of a Window class, we
  use code such as the following:

    obj := Window():new( 5, 10, 15, 70 )

  This statement sends the <U>new()</U> message, with the specified parameters,
  to the Window class. The Window class responds by creating a new Window
  object, and initializing it by invoking the <U>new</U> method defined for the
  Window class. A reference to the newly created and initialized Window
  object is returned to the caller, and in this case the object reference is
  stored in the variable <U>obj</U>.

  For a more detailed discussion of object creation, see <B>Instantiation</B>.
