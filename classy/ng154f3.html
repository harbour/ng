  <B>className</B>

  The <U>className</U> message retrieves the class name, as a character string,
  of the object to which it is sent. For example, the expression
  <U>oWin:className</U> would return the string "Window" if the variable oWin
  referred to an object of class Window.

  The className message is supported by standard Clipper. The Clipper
  classes such as TBrowse return a class name string which is capitalized,
  eg. "TBROWSE". However, class names of Class(y) classes retain the
  capitalization used in their definition.

  <B>Important!</B>

  Using the className message to determine what class an object belongs to
  is not recommended. It is intended mainly for informational and debugging
  purposes. To determine the class of an object, use the class message as
  described in the section <B>Checking an Object's Class</B>.
