 <B>VAR...IS</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Define alternate name for inherited variable

 <B>Syntax</B>

         VAR &lt;variable name&gt; IS &lt;original name&gt;

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;variable name&gt;</B> is the alternative name that the inherited
         variable will be given in the current class

         <B>&lt;original name&gt;</B> is the name of an inherited variable (a
         variable defined in an ancestor class) which the declared
         alternative name will be mapped to.

 <B>Description</B>

         This command allows an alternative name to be defined for an
         existing variable. The existing variable must be defined in an
         ancestor class of the class being created. The command allows a
         class to be tailored so that its message names match its behavior.

 <B>Example</B>

         Assume that a Vehicle class defines a variable called <U>width</U>.
         We would like to define a subclass of Vehicle, called Boat.
         However, the width of a boat at its widest point is usually
         referred to as its <B>beam</B>. We could handle this by writing a
         method in the Boat class:

           METHOD beam
           RETURN ::width

         This handles access to the <U>width</U> variable via the <U>beam</U>
         message. As discussed under the <B>MESSAGE...IS</B> command, this
         could be done more efficiently in the class specification as
         follows:

           MESSAGE beam IS width

         However, neither of these solutions handles assignment via the
         <U>beam</U> message. To support assignment statements of the form:

           oBoat:beam := x

         we can use the <B>VAR...IS</B> command in the class specification as
         follows:

           CREATE CLASS Boat FROM Vehicle
              // ...
              VAR beam IS width

         This will allow both access and assignment to the <U>width</U>
         variable via the <U>beam</U> message.

 <B>Note</B>

         The <B>VAR...IS</B> command can only be used to define an alternative
         name for a variable in an ancestor class. Currently, an
         alternative name for a variable in the current class cannot be
         defined directly. A method can be defined to do this if necessary.
