  <B>Viewing superclass variables</B>

  If the object being viewed belongs to a class which has a superclass, an
  instance variable called <U>super</U> will appear in lower case at the end of
  the instance variable list (as with class variables above). Selecting this
  entry will display the superclass' instance variables as though it were a
  separate object.
