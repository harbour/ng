  <B>System Classes</B>

  Class(y) defines a number of system classes which are used internally.
  Most of these classes will not be linked in to an application unless they
  are used. For example, if you do not use delegation, the classes relating
  to delegated messages will not be linked in. Aside from a few core classes
  such as Class and Object, you only get what you use.

  The names of the system classes are considered reserved words. See the
  <B>Reserved Words</B> section for further information.

  The system classes are:

  Object         Default base class
  Class          Default metaclass
  MIClass        Default metaclass for multiply inherited  classes
  ScalarClass    Default metaclass for scalar classes
  ScalarObject   Default base class for scalar classes
  Symbol         Symbol-handling class
  cmsVariable    Describes instance variables
  cmsMethod      Describes methods
  cmsDeleg       Describes delegated messages
  cmsVarDeleg    Describes delegated variable messages
  cmsRedef       Describes renamed messages
  cmsVarRedef    Describes renamed variables
  cmsShrClsVar   Describes shared class variables

  In addition, there are the scalar classes: Array, Block, Character, Date,
  Integer, Logical, Nil, and Numeric. See the <B>Scalar Classes</B> section for
  more information.
