  <B>Metaclasses</B>

  Class(y) v2.4 treats classes as real objects in every sense. They have a
  class of their own - the predefined class called <U>Class</U>, or a subclass
  thereof.

  The Class class is used to create new classes, as can be seen in the v2.4
  headers. The information used to create a class remains in existence in
  the class object for each class, so classes can be queried at runtime as
  to their structure.

  <B>Important Note</B>

  The operation of metaclasses is not an issue with which most programmers
  need be concerned. Metaclasses are necessary to create a consistent,
  object-oriented, open architecture which allows Class(y) to be cleanly
  enhanced, extended and integrated with other object-oriented system-level
  products. However, for most ordinary programming tasks, metaclasses are
  not required.

  For those who are interested, the architecture of the metaclass system
  will be briefly discussed.

  <B>Warning!</B>

  This subject can be quite confusing, even to experts, and the description
  given here is far from being comprehensive. Again, it is not necessary to
  understand the metaclass architecture to use Class(y) v2.4.

  Any simple class is created as an instance of the Class class. Instances
  of the Class class contain variables such as <U>name</U>, <U>superClass</U>, and
  <U>messages</U>. The contents of these variables describe a particular class.

  Sending the <U>class</U> message to an object will return the class object
  for that class. Examining these objects in the debugger can be
  instructive.

  If a class has class variables, then its class object must contain those
  variables. For example, if a Window class contains a class variable called
  <U>activeList</U>, the variable is stored in Window's class object, not in
  its instances. The class object also contains the variables mentioned
  above, such as <U>name</U> and <U>superClass</U>.

  Such a class object - one containing an additional variable such as
  <U>activeList</U> - is obviously not just an instance of the Class class. It
  must have a class of its own, which we call a metaclass, because it is the
  class of a class.

  A metaclass, like any other class, is an instance of the Class class. But
  what sets it apart from ordinary classes is that its <U>superClass</U> field
  refers to the Class class, or to another metaclass. In other words, all
  metaclasses ultimately inherit from the Class class. This ensures that
  instances of a metaclass have the same basic structure as described by the
  Class class, in addition to any other variables or methods which they may
  define.

  In the Window example, the Window metaclass would contain just a few
  entries in its <U>messages</U> array, including an entry defining the
  <U>activeList</U> variable. Instances of the Window metaclass will therefore
  contain such a variable, in addition to the variables which they inherit
  from their superclass, which as mentioned above, is Class.

  The diagram below illustrates this. The boxes are somewhat similar to the
  display provided by the debugger when looking at a class object. The
  predefined Object class is shown, since all classes ultimately inherit
  from it. The Class class is shown, since all classes are instances of it
  or one of its subclasses. A Rectangle class is shown as a direct instance
  of the Class class. The Rectangle class has no class variables of its own,
  so it can be a direct instance of Class.

  The Window class inherits from the Rectangle class. Since Window has a
  class variable of its own, <U>activeList</U>, it needs a metaclass to
  describe its structure. The Window metaclass is shown inheriting from the
  Class class. The Window class is an instance of the Window metaclass.
  Since the class described by the Window metaclass is a subclass of Class
  because the superclass field refers to Class - the Window class inherits
  all of the methods and instance variables defined in Class, as well as the
  variable <U>activeList</U>, defined in the Window metaclass.

  Each box below is a Class(y) object. The boxes also happen to be class
  objects, since they are all instances of the Class class or one of its
  subclasses (even the Class class object is an instance of the Class class,
  an interesting and necessary circular relationship).

  In the diagram below, the header of each box specifies the class
  represented by that box. In each box's left-hand column, the names of the
  class object's variables are listed. In the right hand column,
  corresponding to each variable, is the value of that variable. Overall, it
  is somewhat similar to the kind of display you see in the debugger.

  The heavy arrows point from a subclass to its superclass. The light arrows
  point from an object to its class, ie. to the class it is an instance of.

  <B>Point of Interest</B>

  The arrows in the first diagram indicate that Object is an instance of
  Class, even though Class is a subclass of Object. This important 'chicken-
  and-egg' relationship is set up by Class(y) on initialization. Another
  aspect of this relationship is the instance arrow which points from the
  Class class back to itself. The Class class object is itself an instance
  of the Class class.
