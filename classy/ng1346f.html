  <B>Length of Variable Names</B>

  Due to the way assignment to instance (and class) variables is implemented
  in Clipper, there is a limitation on the length of such variable names. By
  treating instance and class variables as though their names are only
  significant to nine characters, no problems will occur.

  <B>Technical Note</B>

  The reason for the nine-character limitation on instance variable names is
  that there are two messages associated with each member variable - the
  name of the variable as specified in the class specification, and the same
  name with an underscore prepended. The Clipper compiler converts
  assignments to member variables into a message send using the modified
  instance variable name. Due to the standard ten character width of the
  Clipper symbol table, a variable with a ten character name effectively has
  the last character truncated for assignment purposes. This means that it
  is not possible to have two variables in a class distinguished only by the
  tenth character of their name.
