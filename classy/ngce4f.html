  <B>Class Variables</B>

  Class variables are declared using the <B>CLASS VAR</B> command.

  The value of a class variable is shared by all instances of a class.
  Changing the value of a class variable changes it for all objects in the
  class.

  The class variable values for a class are stored in its class object. The
  value of a class variable can be accessed or changed by sending a message
  to the appropriate class object.

  Class variables are useful for maintaining information that applies to all
  objects in a class. Common uses for class variables include:

  <B>.</B>  maintaining a count of active instances, such as the number of active
     windows in a Window class.

  <B>.</B>  maintaining a reference to the currently active instance, such as the
     currently active DBF object in a DBF class.

  <B>.</B>  maintaining lists of instances for various purposes, such as a list of
     active windows.

  A class inherits its own copy of the class variables in its superclass. In
  other words, the values of inherited class variables are not shared.
  However, it is possible for a subclass to access a class variable belong
  to a superclass - either by using the class function for the desired
  superclass, or by using the <U>super</U> message.

  For example, in a Window class which needs to keep track of which window
  is currently selected, we might use a class variable called
  <U>currSelected</U> for this purpose. In methods in the Window class, we
  could then use code such as this:

    IF self == ::class:currSelected

  to test whether <U>self</U> is the currently selected window. The expression
  <U>::class</U> sends the <U>class</U> message to <U>self</U>, which results in a
  reference to <U>self</U>'s class object. The <U>currSelected</U> message is then
  sent to the class object to obtain the value of the corresponding class
  variable.

  By using the <U>class</U> message to obtain a reference to the class object,
  we ensure that subclasses of  this class will access their own copy of the
  <U>currSelected</U> variable. In many cases, this is the desired behavior;
  but depending on the structure of the class hierarchy, we may wish
  subclasses of Window to share the same <U>currSelected</U> variable. We could
  do this by rewriting the code as follows:

    IF self == Window():currSelected

  Using a class function such as <U>Window()</U> to access a class variable
  will always result in the same class variable being accessed. Even if this
  method was being executed for an instance of a subclass of Window, the
  Window class variable <U>currSelected</U> is accessed.

  However, this technique suffers from a serious disadvantage because
  subclasses still have their own copy of the variables, even if they are
  never used. Aside from the wasted storage, the potential exists for
  inadvertently accessing the wrong variable, causing the program to behave
  incorrectly.

  A safer technique for implementing a variable whose value will be shared
  by subclasses, is to use a file-wide STATIC variable in the appropriate
  class, and provide methods to access and change the value of that variable
  as necessary.

  Class(y) provides yet another alternative in the form of the <B>SHARED</B>
  clause of the <B>CLASS VAR</B> command. Specifying the <B>SHARED</B> clause when
  declaring a class variable will cause that variable to be shared by
  subclasses. See the <B>CLASS VAR</B> command for more details.
