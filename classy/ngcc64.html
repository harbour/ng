  <B>Class Messages</B>

  A class message applies to a class as a whole, rather than to individual
  instances of that class. Class messages can be associated with class
  variables or class methods. A single copy of each class variable is shared
  among all the instances of a class. A class method can access these class
  variables, via its <U>self</U> variable, which is always a class object.
  Class variables and class methods are discussed in more detail below.
