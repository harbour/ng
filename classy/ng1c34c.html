  <B>Reference Objects</B>

  Reference objects are mainly for internal use, but they may be of use in
  applications.

  A reference object refers to another object, in much the same way that two
  different variables in Clipper can refer to the same array (or object).
  The difference is that a reference object can belong to a different class
  from the object it refers to - it can belong to any class in the
  superclass chain of the object it refers to. A reference object can be
  obtained in one of two ways:

  <B>.</B>  By sending the classname of an ancestor class to an object. For
     example, in the expression <U>obj:rectangle</U>, if <U>obj</U> belonged to a
     class which had an ancestor class named Rectangle, a reference object
     of class Rectangle would be returned. The resulting object refers to
     the same object as <U>obj,</U> but will only handle messages belonging to
     class Rectangle and its superclasses. This is similar to casting an
     object pointer in C++.

  <B>.</B>  By sending the <U>super</U> message to an object. The expression
     <U>obj:super</U> results in a reference object belonging to the
     superclass of the class of <U>obj</U>, but referring to the same object
     as <U>obj</U>.
