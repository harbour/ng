 <B>Synopsis</B>

         Invoke method in same class without using a message send

 <B>Syntax</B>

         @:&lt;method name&gt;[ ( [&lt;parameter list&gt;] ) ]

 <B>Arguments</B>

         <B>&lt;method name&gt;</B> is the name of the method to be invoked. It must
         be a method in the same class as the currently executing method,
         and should either be defined in the same program module or
         according to the rules governing <B>external methods</B>.

         <B>&lt;parameter list&gt;</B> is the list of parameters to be sent to the
         method being invoked.

 <B>Description</B>

         Similar to the double-colon (<B>::</B>) for message sends to self,
         the 'at-colon' allows direct invocation of methods in the same
         class as the invoking method. Since the location of the invoked
         method is known in such a case, a message lookup is not necessary.
         A direct invocation of this kind is faster than the equivalent
         message send, but this is a trade-off for loss of flexibility.

 <B>Warning</B>

         This feature should be used with great caution, since it prevents
         methods invoked in this fashion from being overridden in a
         subclass. This is sometimes desirable, however.

         For those familiar with C++, <B>@:</B> allows methods to be invoked
         in a way similar to that in which ordinary (non-virtual) C++
         member functions are invoked. Because of dynamic or late binding,
         methods in Clipper normally behave in a similar way to C++ virtual
         methods.
