  <B>Predefined Messages</B>

  Every class created by Class(y) is automatically given three predefined
  messages, as follows:

    super
    class
    perform

  In addition, a number of messages are defined in the Object class, and are
  thus inherited by all classes. Two such messages are standard messages
  which native Clipper supports:

    classH
    className

  These predefined and standard messages are discussed below.
