 <B>END CLASS</B>

 <B>Synopsis</B>

         End a class specification

 <B>Syntax</B>

         END CLASS

 <B>Description</B>

         This command ends a class specification. This command can only be
         used if a <B>CREATE CLASS</B> command has already been used to begin
         a class specification.

         After the <B>END CLASS</B> command has appeared, the <B>METHOD</B>
         <B>definition</B> command can be used to define the methods which
         were declared in the class specification.

 <B>Note</B>

         After the <B>END CLASS</B> command has appeared in a module, any
         occurrences of the <B>METHOD</B> command are treated as <B>method</B>
         <B>definition</B> commands, rather than <B>method declaration</B>
         commands. This means that the behaviour and syntax of the
         <B>METHOD</B> command is different inside and outside a class
         specification block. See the entries for the <B>METHOD</B>
         <B>(declaration)</B> and <B>METHOD (definition)</B> commands for more
         information.
