  <B>Instantiation</B>

  This section will examine in detail how an object gets created. Class(y)'s
  instantiation mechanism is very open and flexible, and can be customized
  if necessary.

  We will examine what happens when the <U>new()</U> message is sent to a class
  object, as in the following statement:

    oWin := Window():new( 7, 4, 18, 25 )

  1. The <U>new()</U> message is sent to the class. Assuming the class does not
     have a class method named <U>new</U>, the predefined <U>new</U> method in the
     Class class will be invoked.

  2. The <U>new</U> method in the Class class creates an empty instance of the
     class described by the class object which received the message. The
     empty instance is created with the Class method <U>basicNew()</U>, which
     creates a new instance of a class but does not initialize it. Another
     example of the use of <U>basicNew()</U> can be found in the <U>copy()</U>
     method in the Object class.

  3. Having created an empty instance of the correct class, the next step is
     to initialize it. This is done by sending the <U>init()</U> message to the
     newly created object, along with the parameters received by <U>new()</U>.
     This invokes the <U>new</U> method defined in the class (the initializer),
     which should initialize its instance variables appropriately, and
     return. It returns to the Class <U>new</U> method, which returns the
     initialized object to the caller.

  Here is a slightly simplified version of the source to the <U>new()</U>
  method in the Class class:

    METHOD new
       // create an instance of the class described by SELF.
       LOCAL newObj := ::basicNew()
       // invoke the initializer method for that object
       newObj:init()
    RETURN newObj

  One thing is missing from the above code: parameters. Usually, a <U>new()</U>
  message is accompanied by parameters specific to the class being
  instantiated. Under the 2.4 architecture, these parameters would usually
  be passed to the <U>new()</U> method in Class, but in fact it is the
  initializer method in the class being instantiated that needs the
  parameters. Accordingly, all parameters supplied to the Class new() method
  are passed through to the new object's <U>init()</U> method unchanged. To
  achieve this efficiently, the Class <U>new()</U> method is actually
  implemented in C.

  One further twist requires explanation: constructors with names other than
  <U>new</U>. This allows multiple constructor methods for different
  instantiation requirements. A class which supports constructor methods
  other than <U>new</U> needs a definition for the corresponding messages in
  both the class and the metaclass. If we examine the relevant command
  definition in CLASS(Y).CH, we will see something like this:

    #xcommand   METHOD &lt;method&gt; CONSTRUCTOR ;
          =&gt;                           ;
          METHOD &lt;method&gt;                   ;;
          CLASS MESSAGE &lt;method&gt; IS altNew

  An ordinary method is declared using the METHOD command - this is the
  actual constructor method which will initialize the parameter. Then a
  class message is declared which is mapped onto the <U>altNew</U> message,
  defined in the Class class.

  When a constructor message other than <U>new</U> is sent to such a class, the
  <U>altNew()</U> method in Class will be invoked, via the synonym which was
  declared.

  There is thus no longer anything special about constructor methods
  themselves other than the fact that ones other than <U>new</U> require a
  class message mapped onto the <U>altNew </U>method.

  Note that the <B>CONSTRUCTOR</B> clause in the <B>METHOD</B> command is only
  required when declaring constructor methods other than <U>new()</U>.
