  <B>Class Initialization</B>

  When a class is first created (the first time its class function is
  called), some initialization may need to take place. For example, if a
  class has class variables, those variables may need to be initialized. To
  assist with this, if a class defines a class method called initClass, the
  method will be invoked automatically when the class is first created. This
  allows one-time initialization of class variables. The initClass method
  should be declared in the class specification as follows:

    CLASS METHOD initClass

  and defined after the class specification using the <B>METHOD definition</B>
  command. The method will be invoked when its class is first created.

  The initClass method should be written with inheritance in mind. A subclass
  inherits its own copy of all the class variables defined in its ancestor
  classes. When such a subclass is first created, it is necessary to
  initialize those inherited variables. If initClass methods have been
  properly defined in the ancestor classes, a method definition such as the
  following will ensure correct initialization:

    METHOD initClass(), ()
       // initialize class variables defined in
       // this class, but not inherited variables

  The first line of this method definition includes an empty second
  parameter list, which causes the initClass() method in the superclass to
  be invoked, ensuring correct initialization.

  <B>Warning</B>

  If operations other than initialization of class variables are performed
  during the initialization of a class, care must be taken to ensure that
  these operations are not repeated unintentionally when subclasses are
  created. For example, if a database table is opened during initialization
  of a class, it may not be desirable to reopen the table when a subclass is
  created. Appropriate conditional code should be included in the initClass
  method to prevent this.

  Shared class variables - class variables declared with the <B>SHARED</B>
  clause of the <B>CLASS VAR</B> command - are particularly prone to this
  problem. In most cases, an inherited shared class variable should not be
  reinitialized when a subclass is created. To prevent this, code such as
  this can be used:

    METHOD initClass(), ()
       IF ::someVar == NIL
          ::someVar := &lt;value&gt;
       END
    RETURN self

  Assuming someVar has been declared as a shared class variable, this
  initClass method ensures that it will not be initialized more than once,
  even when subclasses are created.
