  <B>Delegating to Sender</B>

  When implementing partially polymorphic delegatee classes as described
  above, it can be useful to have certain messages forwarded to the
  delegator automatically. For example, if a TextWindow class delegates
  messages to a TextBlock class, the TextBlock may need to obtain the
  coordinates of the delegating window. These can be obtained using
  expressions such as SENDER():nTop. However, if a subclass of TextBlock
  were defined, the implementor of the subclass would need to know that it
  should obtain these values from the sender. This situation can be improved
  by defining messages or variables in the TextBlock class that are
  forwarded to the sender, for example:

    VAR nTop TO SENDER

  This allows subclasses of TextBlock to send the nTop message to self,
  instead of SENDER(), to obtain the required value. The implementor of the
  subclass no longer needs to know which messages or variables are actually
  defined in the delegating class.

  <B>Warning</B>

  As always with partially polymorphic delegatee methods, they should only
  be invoked via delegation. A method that relies on messages that are
  automatically forwarded to the sender, as in the above example, will
  behave incorrectly if not invoked via delegation.
