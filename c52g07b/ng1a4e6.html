 <B>SET INDEX command</B>
 Open one or more Order Bags in the current work area
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     SET INDEX TO <B>[&lt;xcOrderBagName list&gt;] [ADDITIVE]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cOrderBagName list&gt;</B> specifies Order Bags to be emptied into the
     Order List of the current work area.

     <B>ADDITIVE</B> adds Order Bags to an existing Order List.

 <B>Description</B>

     By default, SET INDEX, without the ADDITIVE clause, clears the currently
     active Order List, then constructs a new Order List from the Orders in
     the specified Order Bags in the current work area.  When several Order
     Bags are opened, the first Order in the first Order Bag becomes the
     controlling Order (has focus).  The record pointer is initially
     positioned at the first logical identity in this Order.

     If an Order List exists when you SET INDEX ... ADDITIVE, the Orders in
     the new Order Bag are added to the end of the Order List.  The previous
     controlling Order continues to be the controlling Order.

     If no Order List exists when you SET INDEX ... ADDITIVE, the first Order
     in the first Order Bag in &lt;cOrderBagName list&gt; becomes the controlling
     Order.

     During database processing, all open Orders are updated whenever a key
     value is appended or changed, unless the Order was created using a
     scoping condition and the key value does not match.  To change the
     controlling Order without issuing another SET INDEX command, use SET
     ORDER or ORDSETFOCUS().  To add Orders without closing the currently
     open Orders, use the ADDITIVE clause.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example opens a database and its associated indexes:

        USE Sales NEW
        SET INDEX TO Sales, Sales1, Sales2

     <B>.</B>  This example opens an index without closing any indexes that
        are already open:

        SET INDEX TO Sales3 ADDITIVE
