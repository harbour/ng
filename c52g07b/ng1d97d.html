 <B>Using (.cdx) and (.idx) Files Concurrently</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You may use (.cdx) with (.idx) files concurrently (even in the same work
     area); however, in most cases it is easier to use a single (.cdx) index
     for each database file or separate (.idx) files.  When using both types
     of index at the same time, attempting to select an Order based on its
     Order Number can be confusing and will become difficult to maintain.
