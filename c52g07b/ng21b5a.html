     As mentioned above, the DBFNDX driver does not support dBASE III PLUS
     file and record locking schemes.  Instead, the DBFNDX driver supports
     the DBFNTX file and record locking scheme.  This means that if the same
     database and index files are open in CA-Clipper and dBASE III PLUS,
     CA-Clipper program locks are not visible to dBASE III PLUS and vice
     versa.

     <B>Warning!</B> Database integrity is not guaranteed and index corruption
     will occur if CA-Clipper and dBASE III PLUS programs attempt to write to
     a database or index file at the same time.  For this reason, concurrent
     use of the same database (.dbf) and index (.ndx) files by dBASE III PLUS
     and CA-Clipper  programs is strongly discouraged and not supported by
     Computer Associates.
