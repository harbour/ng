 <B>Chapter 2: Replaceable Database Driver Architecture</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The CA-Clipper database system supports a driver architecture that makes
     CA-Clipper-compiled applications data format independent.  Such
     applications can, therefore, access the data formats of other database
     systems, including the dBASE IV (.mdx), FoxPro (.cdx), and Paradox (.db)
     formats on a variety of equipment.  This chapter discusses how RDDs fit
     into the overall CA-Clipper architecture, defines the basic terminology
     you will need to understand subsequent chapters, and summarizes new and
     enhanced commands and functions designed to support the RDD
     architecture.
