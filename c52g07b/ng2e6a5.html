 <B>Performance Concerns</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Because the ANSITERM terminal driver uses buffered screen writes for all
     screen painting, some operations, especially those that scroll the
     screen, are slow.  These include:

     1. All box drawing commands and functions

     2. All console commands and functions when scrolling

     3. All clear screen commands and functions

     4. All restore screen commands and functions

     5. Standard out functions (OUTSTD() and OUTERR()) whether the screen is
        scrolling or not

     <B>Note: </B> Overall performance of CA-Clipper  programs is slower since
     the ANSITERM terminal driver must spend more time polling for user
     events than the standard CA-Clipper  terminal driver.
