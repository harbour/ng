------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CA-Clipper 5.2 provides many new and enhanced commands and functions
     that you will use to access and manipulate databases and to get specific
     information about the RDD in use.  This chapter contains entries for all
     new CA-Clipper commands and functions designed for use with RDDs.  As
     for existing language elements, only those that were changed to
     accommodate the new RDD architecture are documented here.  Other
     language elements that are specifically designed for database
     manipulation and have not been altered (e.g., USE) are documented in the
     Reference guide.
