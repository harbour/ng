 <B>CA-Clipper 5.2 Order Management</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CA-Clipper includes a new Order Management System which provides a more
     effective and flexible way of indexing data.  The main objective of the
     new Order Management implementation is to raise the Xbase indexing
     paradigm from a low level of abstraction (Xbase database specific) to a
     higher, more robust, level.  This higher level of abstraction allows the
     user to build new commands and functions.

     Low level abstraction refers to manipulation of discrete elements in the
     database architecture (i.e., field names and sizes, methods of handling
     controlling indexes, etc.).

     High level abstraction refers to manipulation of general elements in a
     data source.  It lets us, for example, set a controlling Order without
     explicitly addressing the character of the data file structure.  This
     higher level of abstraction was achieved by reviewing all the processes
     that indexes have in common.

     The Order Management function set was generically named (i.e. non-dbf
     specific) to provide a semantic that could encompass future RDD
     implementations that may not be file-bound.  For example, an RDD could
     easily be created that orders (indexes) on a memory array, or other data
     structure, instead of a database.  Therefore, all Order Management
     functions simply begin with ORD (for Order).  You will find the function
     names to be self-explanatory (e.g., ORDCREATE() creates an Order, and
     ORDDESTROY() destroys an Order).
