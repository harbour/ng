 <B>Temporary Indexes</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Temporary indexes are produced by using any scoping clause other than
     the FOR condition in the index creation process.  These indexes are not
     automatically maintainable because the condition is not stored for later
     use.  These indexes can be made maintainable if the condition can be
     expressed as a FOR condition and is added using the FOR clause.  But the
     main use of temporary indexes is for fast creation of indexes for read-
     only browses or reports that operate on a subset of the database.

     Since older applications would not operate properly with indexes that do
     not contain all the keys in a given database, they must be prevented
     from using them.  This is accomplished by modifying the index signature
     to prevent pre-CA-Clipper 5.2 applications from being able to open the
     index.
