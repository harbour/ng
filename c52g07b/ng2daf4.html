 <B>The ANSITERM Alternate Terminal Driver</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The ANSITERM terminal driver supports the ANSI screen mode for all
     screen display from CA-Clipper  programs.

     This screen mode is installed by specifying ANSI.SYS in the user's
     CONFIG.SYS.  ANSI.SYS replaces the default DOS CON device driver for
     video display and keyboard input.  Once installed it supports ANSI
     escape sequences to erase the screen, set the screen mode, and control
     the cursor in a hardware-independent way.  Most modern DOS programs,
     however, do not use it and write either directly to the video hardware
     or use BIOS routines for enhanced screen performance.

     Use the ANSI screen mode for CA-Clipper  programs that run on hardware
     that does not support either writing to video hardware or BIOS calls for
     screen display.  This is the case when using alternative display
     hardware to support the blind.

     <B>Note: </B> The ANSITERM terminal driver fully supports all screen and
     keyboard functionality of the default terminal driver.  This includes
     the ability to save and restore screens and support for all keys on the
     standard 101-key keyboard.
