 <B>SEEK command</B>
 Search an Order for a specified key value
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     SEEK &lt;expSearch&gt; <B>[SOFTSEEK]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;expSearch&gt;</B> is an expression to match with an Order key value.

     <B>SOFTSEEK</B> causes the record pointer to be moved to the next record
     with a higher key value after a failed Order search.  Default behavior
     moves the record pointer to EOF() after a failed Order search.

 <B>Description</B>

     SEEK is a database command that searches the controlling Order from the
     first key value and proceeding until a match is found or there is a key
     value greater than &lt;expSearch&gt;.  If there is a match, the record pointer
     is positioned to the identity found in the Order.  If SOFTSEEK is OFF
     (the default) and SEEK does not find a match, the record pointer is
     positioned to LASTREC() + 1, EOF() returns true (.T.), and FOUND()
     returns false (.F.).

     SOFTSEEK enables a method of searching an Order and returning a record
     even if there is no match for a specified key.

     When SOFTSEEK is ON and a match for a SEEK is not found, the record
     pointer is set to the next record in the Order with a higher key value
     than the SEEK argument.  Records not visible because SET FILTER and/or
     SET DELETED are skipped when searching for the next higher key value.
     If there is no record with a higher key value, the record pointer is
     positioned at LASTREC() + 1, EOF() returns true (.T.), and FOUND()
     returns false (.F.).  FOUND() returns true (.T.) only if the record is
     actually found.  FOUND() never returns true (.T.) for a relative find.

     When SOFTSEEK is OFF and a SEEK is unsuccessful, the record pointer is
     positioned at LASTREC() + 1, EOF() returns true (.T.), and FOUND()
     returns false (.F.).

     SEEK with the SOFTSEEK clause is, effectively, the same as performing
     SET SOFTSEEK then SEEK in earlier versions of CA-Clipper except that is
     does not change the global setting of SOFTSEEK.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  The following example searches for "Doe" using the SEEK
        command:

        USE Customer NEW
        SET ORDER TO Customer

        ? SET( _SET_SOFTSEEK )   // (.F.)
        SEEK "Doe"
        ? SET( _SET_SOFTSEEK )   // Still (.F.)

        IF FOUND()
           .
           . &lt; statements &gt;
           .
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  The following example performs a soft seek for "Doe" using
        SOFTSEEK clause of the SEEK command:

        USE Customer NEW
        SET ORDER TO Customer

        SEEK "Doe" SOFTSEEK

        IF !FOUND()
           ? Customer-&gt;Name      // Returns next logical name after "Doe"
        ENDIF
