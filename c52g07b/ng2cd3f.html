 <B>Chapter 9: Alternate Terminal Drivers</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CA-Clipper supports a driver architecture that allows CA-Clipper-
     compiled applications to use alternate terminal drivers.  This
     architecture provides support for nonstandard video hardware and ANSI
     output devices, allowing your applications to run in a wider variety of
     environments.

     The following terminal drivers are supplied as part of the CA-Clipper
     Development System and are discussed in this chapter:

     <B>.</B>  The ANSITERM driver provides ANSI terminal support for systems
        that require it

     <B>.</B>  The NOVTERM driver causes CA-Clipper applications to execute
        faster when run on some nondedicated network server software

     <B>.</B>  The PCBIOS driver provides direct BIOS calls rather than
        direct screen writes for systems requiring this form of I/O
