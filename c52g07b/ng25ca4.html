 <B>Error Handling</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Corruption Detected</B>

     Since older applications have no knowledge of the new index features nor
     how to interpret the additional flags in the header signature, these
     applications will assume the index is corrupt and will produce an Index
     Corrupted error.

 <B>EOF()</B>

     If an index is created with a FOR condition and an attempt is made to
     update the index with a key that does not match the condition, the
     update is suppressed and the index is placed at EOF().  This is
     consistent with the current behavior for indexes created with the unique
     flag when an update is attempted with a non-unique key.

     Also if a navigational action is attempted (SKIP) and the current record
     is not found in the index, the index will place the record pointer at
     EOF().  This is true for both conditional and temporary indexes.
