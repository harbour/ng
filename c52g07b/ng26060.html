 <B>Compatibility</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Backward Compatibility</B>

     If the conditional or temporary indexing features are used the index
     produced will not be backward compatible with applications compiled with
     previous versions of CA-Clipper.  Indexes that do not use the features,
     however, will be 100% compatible.

 <B>Forward Compatibility</B>

     Indexes created by applications built with a previous version of
     CA-Clipper can be used by CA-Clipper 5.2 and will not be modified unless
     the index is recreated using either the conditional or temporary index
     features.

 <B>Error Message Produced by Old Applications</B>

     Since older applications have no knowledge of the new index locking
     scheme nor of the significance of the header signature, these
     applications will assume the index is corrupt and will produce an Index
     Corrupted error.
