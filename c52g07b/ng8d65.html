------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The following list contains specific information regarding Order Bag
     usage and limitations with DBFNDX and DBFNTX index files:

     <B>.</B>  Single-Order Bags:  With DBFNDX and DBFNTX you can explicitly
        assign the Order Name within the Order creation syntax.  You can then
        use the Order Name in any command or function that accepts  an Order
        Name (Tag) as a parameter.

     <B>.</B>  Single-Order Bag with INDEX ON:  Single-Order Bags may retain
        the Order Name between activations.  During creation, DBFNTX stores
        an optionally supplied Order Name in the file's header for subsequent
        use.  Therefore, the Order Name is not necessarily the same as that
        of the file.  By contrast, DBFNDX cannot store an Order Name since
        this would prevent dBASE from accessing the file.  By default DBFNDX
        Orders inherit the name of their index file.
