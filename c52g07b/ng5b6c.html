 <B>User Interface Levels</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We want to make it easy for you to quickly take advantage of the added
     functionality provided in CA-Clipper 5.2. In order to effectively use
     the RDDs, you should read the following discussions.  They are provided
     as a means of identifying the degree of programming knowledge or
     CA-Clipper experience that will let you effectively use the RDD
     features.

     For this purpose the RDD feature set is arbitrarily divided into levels
     A and B.  Tables listing the commands or functions that comprise these
     access levels are also supplied.  In addition, an RDD Features Summary
     is provided in table form which outlines the features available in each
     driver.  The commands and functions in both of these levels of access
     are described in the Reference chapter of this guide.

 <B>Level A - Command-Level Interface</B>

     <B>Level A.</B>  a simple command-level interface very similar to those
     found in other languages (e.g., dBASE IV, FoxPro).  This is the primary
     access for new CA-Clipper users who may or may not be familiar with
     other languages.

     The following table lists the commands and functions accessible by the
     CA-Clipper programmer with background in languages such as dBASE or
     FoxPro.  The commands and functions in this table provide access to the
     additional features without requiring an advanced knowledge of
     CA-Clipper or other programming concepts.

     <B>Basic Commands and Functions</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Command/Function  Changes</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     DELETE TAG        Delete a Tag
     GOTO              Move the pointer to the specified identity
     INDEX             Create an index file
     SEEK              Search an Order for a specified key value
     SET INDEX         Open one or more Order Bags in the current work area
     SET ORDER         Select the controlling Order
     DBAPPEND()        Append a new record to the current Lock List
     DBRLOCK()         Lock the record at the current or specified identity
     DBRLOCKLIST()     Return an array of the current Lock List
     DBRUNLOCK         Release all or specified record locks
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Level B - Function-Level Interface</B>

     <B>Level B.</B>  CA-Clipper also adds a function level interface that not
     only allows access to the enhanced functionality of the drivers, but
     permits the building of higher-level functions using these composing
     behaviors.  This level is meant for more experienced CA-Clipper users
     who need to take advantage of the full power of the driver and Order
     Management System.

     The following table lists the DML and Order Management functions
     recommended to the intermediate to advanced CA-Clipper programmer.
     These functions provide the greatest flexibility in accessing the
     extended features of these drivers

 <B>RDD Features </B>

     The following decision table summarizes the availability of key features
     across RDDs.  It lists the features available in each RDD so you can use
     it as an aid in correct RDD implementation and data access.
