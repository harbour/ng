 <B>Index Management</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The greatest variation from the standard Xbase database design in
     Paradox tables is index management.  As in other systems, Paradox
     indexes are an efficient method of dynamically sorting or locating
     specific data within a table without forcing a search of all data in
     that table.  Paradox tables take two forms: unkeyed and keyed.

     An unkeyed table has no fields in its structure that have been
     identified as specific index keys.  Therefore, records are maintained in
     natural order.  New records are added to the end of an existing table,
     and the unique identity for each record is a record number.

     Unlike Xbase data files, unkeyed tables are not more efficient in design
     or faster to traverse than keyed tables.  This is because Paradox tables
     are built as linked lists rather than fixed-length, sequential tables.
     Therefore, it is actually less efficient to SKIP through a unkeyed table
     than it is through a keyed table.

     A keyed table, on the other hand, can be lightning fast as long as the
     data you seek is part of the key.  Otherwise, just as in an unkeyed
     table, you are forced to do a sequential search through the table's data
     fields.

     Paradox tables support two types of keys or indexes.

     <B>.</B>  Primary

     <B>.</B>  Secondary

 <B>Primary Indexes</B>

     Primary indexes are directly tied to keyed tables because a primary
     index indicates the table is keyed.  Simply, it is impossible to have a
     keyed table without a primary index.  If you remove the primary index
     from a keyed table it becomes an unkeyed table.

     When you identify one or more of the table's fields as a key field (by
     placing an asterisk (*) at the end of the field name) during table
     creation/restructuring, these fields are used to create a primary index.
     (Note that all key fields must be together as the first fields in a
     table).  This invisibly rebuilds the table's structure, though in
     operation it only seems to change or create the key index.

     Once you identify this primary key, the table is automatically
     maintained in the key field order and all new records are checked to
     make sure that no duplicate keys are added to the table.  This type of
     index is called a unique key index.  You may have only one primary key
     per table, but this key can be a composite of many fields in the table.
     You may only modify by restructuring the table.

     If it is necessary to change a primary key and restructure a table, all
     data in the table will still be bound to the unique key restriction.
     This is important if you change the primary key by adding a new field to
     it and there is already data in the table where this new composite key
     would have duplicates.

     DBPX handles this situation by generating a runtime error and removing
     every record that violates this unique key and moving it to another
     table named KEYVIOL.db which has the identical structure of the
     offending table.

     The KEYVIOL.db is automatically generated whenever this situation
     occurs.  If there is already a KEYVIOL table, it is overwritten.
     Because of this you should always check for the existence of a
     KEYVIOL.db table immediately after any type of table restructuring.

 <B>Secondary Indexes</B>

     Secondary indexes are more like common Xbase-type indexes because they
     can be generated or modified on the fly without having any effect on the
     data or table structure and aren't restricted to unique key data.

     Unlike Xbase indexes, secondary indexes can only contain a single field
     as their key.  As mentioned earlier, primary indexes are automatically
     maintained so that they are always up to date.  Secondary indexes are
     created in two different types.

     <B>.</B>  Incremental (for keyed tables)

     <B>.</B>  Independent (for unkeyed tables)

     Independent indexes are created only for unkeyed tables and are not
     dynamically maintained in any way.  Because of this they can only be
     considered accurate at the time of their creation.  If data changes
     inside the table that affects the index, the index must be completely
     regenerated before it can be considered useful again.

     Alternately, incremental indexes are created only for keyed tables and
     are automatically maintained similarly to primary indexes except that
     instead of a complete rebuild at every change, only the portion of the
     index affected is updated.  Incremental indexes are preferable when you
     are handling large tables since they take considerably less time and
     energy to keep accurate.

 <B>Temporary Indexes</B>

     ALL, NEXT, RECORD, and REST are all supported in the scoping
     expressions. The syntax of these keywords is identical to that used in
     CA-Clipper.  Note that you can only use one scope keyword at a time.  If
     more than one of these keywords is encountered in a scoping expression,
     then the last keyword in the expression is the option used.

     The ALL keyword (default) specifies that all records in the table should
     be included in the operation, starting at the first record.

     NEXT processes the specified number of records, starting with the
     current record.  For example, NEXT 5 would process the current record
     and the four records following it.

     The RECORD keyword identifies a specific record to process.  The desired
     record number should follow the keyword RECORD.  To process record
     number 3, you would include "RECORD 3" in the expression.

     The REST keyword causes processing to begin with the current record,
     instead of starting at the beginning of the table.
