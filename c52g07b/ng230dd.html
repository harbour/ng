------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Index files (.ntx) created with the original DBFNTX driver are
     compatible with DBFNTX and can be used in new applications without
     reindexing.  Index files (.ntx) created with this version of DBFNTX will
     also work with previous CA-Clipper applications provided that you use no
     FOR, WHILE, &lt;scope&gt;, or DESCENDING clauses.

     <B>Important! </B> Indexes produced with DBFNTX using FOR or DESCENDING are
     incompatible with earlier version (.ntx) files.  If you attempt to
     access them with the original DBFNTX database driver or programs
     compiled with versions earlier than CA-Clipper 5.2, you will get an
     unrecoverable runtime error.  In CA-Clipper, this generates an "index
     corrupted" error message, causing the application to terminate.
