     With the introduction of the new RDDs, CA-Clipper provides many new and
     enhanced commands and functions that access and manipulate databases.
     These language elements can enable your applications to access data
     regardless of the RDD under which it is ordered.  There are also
     commands and functions that give you specific information about the RDDs
     in use.

     The Language Implementation section of this chapter includes tables that
     summarize these new and enhanced language elements.  This chapter also
     covers basic terminology, implementation principals, and general
     concepts of the Order Management System.

     The following major topics are discussed:

     <B>.</B>  RDD Basics

     <B>.</B>  Basic Terminology

     <B>.</B>  The Language Implementation

     <B>.</B>  Order Management System
