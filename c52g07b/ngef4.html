 <B>Overview of Alternate Terminal Drivers</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     An Alternate Terminal Driver is a library file (.LIB) that controls how
     your application addresses the screen output device.  CA-Clipper
     provides several Alternate Terminal Drivers to allow your applications
     to run in a wider variety of environments.

     <B>Note:</B>  To perform normal information presented in screen
     input/output in a CA-Clipper application, you do not need the Drivers
     guide.  The default database and terminal drivers are automatically
     linked and the commands and functions used for these purposes are
     discussed in the Reference guide.  For several categorized lists of
     these commands and functions, refer to Appendix G: Categorized Language
     Tables in the Error Messages and Appendices guide.
