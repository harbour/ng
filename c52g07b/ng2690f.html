 <B>Using the DBFNTX Database Driver </B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In applications written for the new DBFNTX driver, you can use the INDEX
     and REINDEX commands exactly as you have used them in the past.  The
     index files (.ntx) you create and maintain in this way are completely
     compatible with those created using previous versions of the driver.

     Changes to existing code are necessary only if you use the new indexing
     features.  The (.ntx) files you create using the new features will have
     a slightly different header file and cannot be used by programs linked
     with a previous version of the driver.
