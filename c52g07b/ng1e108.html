 <B>Tips For Using DBFCDX</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Make sure index extensions aren't hard-coded in your application.
        The default extension for DBFCDX indexes is (.idx), not (.ntx).  You
        can still use (.ntx) as the extension as long as you specify the
        extension when you create your indexes.  The best way to determine
        index extensions in an application is to call ORDBAGEXT().

        For example, if you currently use the following code to determine the
        existence of an index file:

        IF .NOT. FILE("index.ntx")
           INDEX ON field TO index
        ENDIF

        Change the code to include the INDEXEXT() function, as follows:

        IF .NOT. FILE("index"+ORDBAGEXT())
           INDEX ON field TO index
        ENDIF

     2. If your application uses memo fields, you should convert your (.dbt)
        files to (.fpt) files.

        There are some good reasons for using (.fpt) files.  Most important
        is the smaller block size (64 bytes).  CA-Clipper's (.dbt) files use
        a fixed block size of 512 bytes which means that every time you store
        even 1 byte in a memo field CA-Clipper uses 512 bytes to store it.
        If the data in a memo field grows to 513 bytes, then two blocks are
        required.

        When creating (.fpt) files, the block size is set at 64 bytes to
        optimize it for your needs.  A simple conversion from (.dbt) files to
        (.fpt) files will generally shrink your memo files by approximately
        30%.

     3. Add DBFCDX.LIB as a library to your link command or link script.
