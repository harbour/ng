 <B>Compact Indexes</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Like FoxPro 2, The DBFCDX driver creates compact indexes.  This means
     that the key data is stored in a compressed format, resulting in a
     substantial size reduction in the index file.  Compact indexes store
     only the actual data for the index keys.  Trailing blanks and duplicate
     bytes between keys are stored in one or two bytes.  This allows
     considerable space savings in indexes with much empty space and similar
     keys.  Since the amount of compression is dependent on many variables,
     including the number of unique keys in an index, the exact amount of
     compression is impossible to predetermine.
