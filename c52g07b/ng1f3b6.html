 <B>Using the DBFMDX Database Driver</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     To use (.mdx) files in a CA-Clipper  program:

     1. Place REQUEST DBFMDX at the beginning of your application or at top
        of the first program file (.prg) that opens a database file using the
        DBFMDX driver.

     2. Specify the VIA "DBFMDX" clause if you open the database file with
        the USE command.

        -OR-

     3. Specify "DBFMDX" for the &lt;cDriver&gt; argument if you open the database
        file with the DBUSEAREA() function.

        -OR-

     4. Use RDDSETDEFAULT("DBFMDX") to set the default driver to DBFMDX.

        Except in the case of REQUEST, the RDD name must be a literal
        character string or a variable.  In all cases it is important that
        the driver name be spelled correctly using uppercase letters.

     Though the DBFMDX driver supports numbered indexes, you should avoid
     using them (e.g., in operations like SET ORDER and INDEXKEY()).  In a
     multiple-index system you do not have the absolute control of the
     numeric position of an open index that you have in a single-index
     system.  As you add, delete, and rebuild index TAGs, their numeric
     position may change.  You should make all command references by name.
     For example:

     SET ORDER TO [&lt;nOrder&gt; | [TAG &lt;cOrderName&gt;] [IN &lt;xcOrderBagName&gt;]]
