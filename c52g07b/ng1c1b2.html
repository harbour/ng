 <B>Overview of the DBFCDX RDD</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The DBFCDX driver lets you create and maintain (.cdx) and (.idx) files
     with features different from those supplied with the original DBFNTX
     driver and is compatible with files created under FoxPro 2. The new
     features are supplied in the form of several syntactical additions to
     the INDEX and REINDEX commands.  Specifically, you can:

     <B>.</B>  Create indexes smaller than those created with the DBFNTX
        driver.  The key data is stored in a compressed format that
        substantially reduces the size of the index file.

     <B>.</B>  Create a compound index file that contains multiple indexes
        (TAGs), making it possible to open several indexes under one file
        handle.  A single (.cdx) file may contain up to 99 index keys.

     <B>.</B>  Create conditional indexes (FOR / WHILE / REST / NEXT).

     <B>.</B>  Create files with FoxPro 2 file format compatibility.
