------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The DBFNTX driver provides file and record locking schemes that are
     different from dBASE III PLUS schemes.  This means that if the same
     database and index files are open in CA-Clipper and in dBASE III PLUS,
     CA-Clipper program locks are not visible to dBASE III PLUS and vice
     versa.

     <B>Warning</B>! Database integrity is not guaranteed and index corruption
     will occur if CA-Clipper and dBASE III PLUS programs attempt to write to
     a database or index file at the same time.  Therefore, concurrent use of
     the same database (.dbf) and index (.ndx) files by dBASE III PLUS and
     CA-Clipper programs is strongly discouraged and not supported by
     Computer Associates.
