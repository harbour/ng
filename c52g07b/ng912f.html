 <B>Summary</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This chapter has introduced you to the RDD concept, giving you specific
     information on the architecture that implements RDDs in CA-Clipper.  The
     basic terminology of RDDs has also been defined.

     Finally, you have seen an overview of the language enhancements designed
     to make using RDDs straightforward and to let you build applications
     that do not depend on the RDD in use.  The next chapter elaborates on
     these language enhancements, discussing syntax and usage in detail.
