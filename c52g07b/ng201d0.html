 <B>Overview of the DBFNDX RDD</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The DBFNDX database driver allows creation, access, and updating of
     dBASE III and dBASE III PLUS compatible index (.ndx) files.  Index files
     (.ndx) created with CA-Clipper  are exactly the same as those created by
     dBASE III PLUS.  All operations that can be performed on standard
     CA-Clipper index (.ntx) files can be performed on (.ndx) files using the
     DBFNDX database driver.

     In a network environment, the DBFNDX driver supports the CA-Clipper
     file and record locking scheme.  The multiuser behavior is the same as
     the default DBFNTX driver.  This means that the DBFNDX database driver
     supports concurrent access to (.ndx) files between CA-Clipper
     applications only.  Concurrent access to (.ndx) files between dBASE III
     PLUS and CA-Clipper programs is not supported.

     <B>Important! </B> Updating database (.dbf) and index (.ndx) files shared
     between dBASE III PLUS and CA-Clipper programs may corrupt the (.dbf)
     and any of its associated (.ndx) files.
