------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>Important! </B> Some of the topics in this guide are intended for
     advanced CA-Clipper developers.  Much of this information is presented
     at a fairly high level and requires programming knowledge beyond the
     CA-Clipper language.  Other parts are useful to users of all levels.
     Refer to the "User Interface Levels" section of the Replaceable Database
     Driver Architecture chapter to determine which part of the language is
     appropriate to your level of expertise.

     Based on your own experience level with the CA-Clipper language, you
     should decide whether you wish to take advantage of these new and
     advanced features.  The Reference guide contains existing CA-Clipper
     command and function syntax and descriptions.  This guide addresses new
     extensions to CA-Clipper.  Understanding this information should enable
     you to increase the power and effectiveness of your applications.

     CA-Clipper 5.2 supports a driver architecture that allows CA-Clipper-
     compiled applications to use replaceable database and terminal drivers.
     This Drivers guide contains all the information you need to use the
     replaceable drivers provided as part of the CA-Clipper Development
     System.
