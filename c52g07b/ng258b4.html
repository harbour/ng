 <B>Conditional Indexes</B>

     The developer need only specify the FOR condition when creating the
     index.  In doing so he must be fully aware the index will no longer be
     accessible to pre-CA-Clipper 5.2 applications.

 <B>Temporary Indexes</B>

     The developer need only specify a scope other than FOR when creating the
     index.  In doing so he must be fully aware the index will no longer be
     accessible to pre-CA-Clipper 5.2 applications and that the index created
     is not maintainable.

     The signature byte of a .NTX file is 6 for a unenhanced NTX index.  If
     the index is created as a conditional index it will have a signature of
     7 hex (6 hex ORed with 1 hex).  If the index is created as a temporary
     index it will have a signature of E hex.  (6 hex ORed with 8 hex).  See
     Figure 7-1 for an illustration of all the possible values for the
     signature byte.
