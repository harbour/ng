 <B>The NOVTERM Alternate Terminal Driver</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The NOVTERM terminal driver is a special-purpose driver that circumvents
     an incompatibility between some nondedicated network server software and
     CA-Clipper.  This incompatibility causes printers connected to the
     server to slow to an unusable rate.

     CA-Clipper applications and nondedicated servers compete for resources.
     CA-Clipper  applications make use of the time between keystrokes to
     perform various system tasks.  This greatly improves the application's
     overall performance by limiting its idle time.  Certain nondedicated
     servers only attempt to print within an application's idle time.  Since
     a CA-Clipper application is seldom idle, this greatly slows printing.

     <B>Important! </B> The NOVTERM terminal driver corrects the incompatibility
     by preventing the CA-Clipper application from using idle time.  Because
     this can severely hamper performance, you should only use the NOVTERM
     terminal driver when necessary, and then you should link it only into
     those applications that are physically running the nondedicated server.

     <B>Note: </B> The NOVTERM terminal driver fully supports all screen and
     keyboard functionality of the default terminal driver.  This includes
     the ability to save and restore screens and support for all keys on the
     standard 101-key keyboard.
