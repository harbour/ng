 <B>goHot()</B>
 Mark the workarea data buffer as hot
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>ERRCODE goHot(</B>
     <B>               WORKAREAP wa</B>
     <B>             )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

 <B>Description</B>

     Informs the RDD that data in memory is not guaranteed to match data in
     the data store (usually a disk).

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The concept of hot and cold refers to the current state of
        information in memory as it relates to information on disk.  If the
        information in memory, has changed since last written to disk, it is
        considered hot.  A cold workarea's memory is in sync with its disk-
        based counterpart.

     <B>.</B>  When a workarea goes hot in a shared environment, you must be
        certain that all necessary locks are in place.  Going hot indicates
        that a write is about to be performed on data.

     <B>.</B>  You must never allow workareas marked as wa-&gt;readonly to
        goHot().  This is an ideal place to generate runtime recoverable
        errors indicating that locks must be present or the workarea must not
        be in a read-only mode.

     <B>.</B>  wa should remain hot until it is marked cold by goCold().
