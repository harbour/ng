 <B>childEnd()</B>
 Report end of relation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>ERRCODE childEnd(</B>
     <B>                  WORKAREAP wa,</B>
     <B>                  DBRELINFOP dbRelInfo</B>
     <B>                )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>dbRelInfo</B> is a pointer to a structure containing information on a
     relation.

 <B>Description</B>

     Indicates that one of wa's parent workareas is no longer related.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     childEnd() indicates that the referenced workarea is related to one less
     parent by decrementing wa-&gt;parents.  This method does not physically
     unhook a child from a parent.

     <B>Warning! </B> There is no check to guarantee that wa-&gt;parent will wrap
     from 0 to 255 after the decrement.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  If your RDD supports relations, ensure that the child workarea
        (denoted by wa) does not have a pending relational move that relies
        upon the existence of the parent referenced by dbRelInfo.  If such a
        movement exists, it must be resolved by a call to SELFFORCEREL()
        prior to removal.

     <B>.</B>  In most driver implementations, parent-child relations will be
        stored exclusively in the parent workarea.  clearRel() removes all
        child relations from a parent; there is no way to remove a single
        relation from a parent's relation list using the CA-Clipper DML.
