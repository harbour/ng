 <B>Elements</B>

     <B>active</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether one or more valid
        conditions have been specified in the structure.

     <B>cFor / bFor</B>

        Contain a CA-Clipper-level reference to a string and a matching code
        block containing the key expression defining the FOR condition to be
        used for the creation and maintenance of the Order.

     <B>bWhile</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level reference to a code block defining the
        WHILE condition to be used for the creation of the Order.  If NIL, no
        WHILE condition is being specified.

     <B>bEval</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level reference to a code block defining the
        expression to be evaluated every step rows (records) during the
        creation of the Order.  The code block referenced should always
        evaluate to either TRUE (indicating that creation of the Order should
        continue normally) or FALSE (indicating that Order creation should
        terminate).  A return value of FALSE from bEval does not constitute
        an error condition but rather is the mechanism by which an RDD is
        informed that no more rows are to be included in the Order.

     <B>step</B>

        Contains a numeric value determining the frequency of the evaluation
        of bEval.

     <B>startRecord</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the row at which to begin
        processing when either the nextCount or rest scoping options are
        specified.

     <B>nextCount</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the number of rows to process for
        Order creation.

     <B>record</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating a single row to include in the
        Order.

     <B>rest</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating that only the rows specified by
        startRecord through end-of-file (EOF) are to be included in the
        Order.

     <B>descending</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the Order should be
        created in descending Order.

     <B>scoped</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the Order is to be
        scoped.  scoped will be TRUE if any of bWhile, nextCount, record,
        rest, or all are specified.

     <B>all</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether all rows are to be
        processed during Order creation.
