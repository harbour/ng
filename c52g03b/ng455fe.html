 <B>Elements</B>

     <B>ftable</B>

        Contains a pointer to the virtual method table for this workarea (see
        DBFUNCTABLE).

     <B>area</B>

        Contains a numeric value representing the number assigned to this
        workarea.  This number is analogous to the value returned by the
        CA-Clipper SELECT() function.

     <B>alias</B>

        Contains a character data type value representing the CA-Clipper
        ALIAS of the workarea.

     <B>fieldExtent</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the total number of columns
        allocated for the workarea.  Columns are allocated by a call to
        setFieldExtent().

     <B>fieldCount</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the total number of columns
        currently in use by the workarea.  fieldCount is incremented with
        each call to addField().

     <B>fields</B>

        Contains a pointer to an array of FIELD items.  fields defines all
        the fields used by this workarea including type, length, and name
        (see FIELD).

     <B>result</B>

        Contains an Item that is used on occasion by the CA-Clipper runtime
        system and may be used by the RDD developer as an all purpose result
        holder for an operation.

     <B>top</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if the record pointer is
        on the first logical record.

     <B>bottom</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if the record pointer is
        on the last logical record.

     <B>bof</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if logical beginning-of-
        file is reached.

     <B>eof</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if logical end-of-file
        is reached.

     <B>found</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE when a seek() operation
        successfully locates a key value.

     <B>locate</B>

        Contains a data structure specifying the scoping condition used by
        the CA-Clipper LOCATE command (see DBSCOPEINFO).

     <B>filter</B>

        Contains a data structure specifying the filter condition to use for
        the workarea (see DBFILTERINFO).

     <B>relations</B>

        Contains information about relations currently in use by the workarea
        (see DBRELINFO).

     <B>parents</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the number of parent workareas
        currently in effect for this workarea.

     <B>heap</B>

        Contains a virtual memory handle that can be used by the RDD
        developer to allocate a VM heap and make use of the VM heap
        suballocation routines available through the Virtual Memory API.

     <B>heapSize</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the size of the heap, above.

     <B>rddID</B>

        Reserved.

     <B>Note: </B> In addition to being used by the data structures indicated
     below, the WORKAREA structure is used by all methods in the RDD API.
