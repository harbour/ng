 <B>goCold()</B>
 Perform write to data store of workarea memory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>ERRCODE goCold(</B>
     <B>                WORKAREAP wa</B>
     <B>              )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

 <B>Description</B>

     Forces the RDD to ensure that any data contained in memory matches that
     stored in the data store (usually a disk).

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The concept of hot and cold refers to the current state of
        information in memory as it relates to information on disk.  If the
        information in memory, has changed since last written to disk, it is
        considered hot.  A cold workarea's memory is in sync with its disk-
        based counterpart.

        In any implementation of goCold(), you should determine whether the
        buffer holding the current cursor's data has been written to.  If so,
        it is hot and must be turned cold by flushing or writing it to disk.

     <B>.</B>  wa should remain cold until it is marked hot by goHot().
