 <B>_xvwire()</B>
 Obtain a long term lock on a VM segment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>C Prototype</B>

     <B>#include "vm.api"</B>
     <B>FARP _xvwire(</B>
     <B>              HANDLE hSegment</B>
     <B>            )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>hSegment</B> is the VM segment handle returned by _xvalloc().

 <B>Returns</B>

     _xvwire() returns a far pointer to the base of the locked VM segment, or
     a NULL pointer if the segment pointer is not valid (i.e., does not
     represent an allocated segment).

 <B>Description</B>

     _xvwire() moves a segment to the low end of VM swap space and locks it,
     preventing the segment from being moved or swapped.  Locking a VM
     segment allows access to it through a standard far pointer.

     VM segments locked by _xvwire() must be unlocked by _xvunwire().

     <B>Warning! </B> Segments that you lock with _xvlock() may be placed in the
     middle of the swap space.  Thus, if you hold the lock for a long period
     of time, the swap space can become fragmented, reducing the size of the
     largest contiguous memory block available.

     _xvwire(), on the other hand, moves the locked segment to the lowest
     possible position within the swap space.  Thus, if you use _xvwire() to
     lock a segment for a long period of time, you avoid fragmentation.

     <B>Note: </B> You may lock VM segment more than once.  The VMM system
     maintains, for each segment, a lock count (_xvlockcount()) which is
     incremented each time you lock the segment and decremented each time you
     unlock the segment.  A segment is not physically unlocked until its lock
     count is zero.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  _xvwire() vs. _xvlock(): </B> The question of when to use _xvwire() and
        when to use _xvlock() is one of efficiency.  _xvlock() is faster at
        locking segments, but you must unlock the segments relatively quickly
        or they will inhibit the VMM system.

        _xvwire() is slower at locking segments, but you can maintain the
        segment locks for a long period of time.  This gives functions access
        to the wired segment without having to lock it.

        A good example of the need for _xvwire() is a serial communications
        buffer.  The initialization routine is not affected by the extra time
        it takes to wire a segment, but the ISR for the communications port
        needs instant access to memory and, thus, cannot afford to wait for a
        segment to be locked.

     <B>.  Error conditions: </B> If the segment cannot be loaded into conventional
        memory because of insufficient VM swap space, the system raises an
        internal error and halts.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example allocates a segment with _xvalloc() and locks it
        with _xvwire().  After a string is copied into the segment, it is
        unlocked and freed.
