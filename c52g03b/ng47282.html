     <B>ERRCODE goTo(</B>
     <B>              WORKAREAP wa,</B>
     <B>              ULONG row</B>
     <B>            )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>row</B> is the row number of the new cursor position.

 <B>Description</B>

     Repositions the workarea cursor for wa to the physical row number row.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  Since goTo() repositions the pointer to a physical row number,
        you need not consider active scopes or filters.  If the row is not in
        the physical range of rows available, you may generate an error or
        position the pointer at the physical end of file.

     <B>.</B>  In CA-Clipper, the idea of a phantom row is vital to the
        performance of certain functions.  The goTo() method should permit
        access to the phantom row.  The phantom row is defined as the last
        row + 1 and is the position at which end of file is set to true  All
        columns of the phantom row are empty.  A row value greater than the
        last row in the table should position the pointer to the phantom row.
        If you do not support the concept of the phantom row in your driver,
        you must document that fact as an incompatibility of your driver with
        the high-level CA-Clipper syntax.
