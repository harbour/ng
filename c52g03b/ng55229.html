 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>dbOrderInfo</B> is a pointer to a structure containing information about
     the Order Bag to be opened.

 <B>Description</B>

     Opens an Order Bag with all its associated Orders in the workarea.  This
     functionality is analogous to the CA-Clipper SET INDEX TO...ADDITIVE
     command.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  Before an Order can be attached to the workarea, the
        workarea's buffer should be written to disk in a SELFGOCOLD() call.

     <B>.</B>  It is recommended that you place a limit on the number of open
        Orders per workarea since memory is a finite resource, even if you
        tap the power of the Virtual Memory API to supply you with memory.

     <B>.</B>  By convention, once the Order is set, a SELFGOTOP() should be
        issued to remain consistent with the CA-Clipper DML.
