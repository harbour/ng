 <B>_xvlock()</B>
 Lock a VM segment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>C Prototype</B>

     <B>#include "vm.api"</B>
     <B>FARP _xvlock(</B>
     <B>              HANDLE hSegment</B>
     <B>            )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>hSegment</B> is the VM segment handle returned by _xvalloc().

 <B>Returns</B>

     _xvlock() returns a far pointer to the base of the locked VM segment, or
     a NULL pointer if the VM segment handle is not valid (i.e., does not
     represent an allocated VM segment).

 <B>Description</B>

     _xvlock() guarantees that the VM segment is located in conventional
     memory and cannot be moved or swapped.  The pointer returned is valid
     until the segment is unlocked using _xvunlock().

     <B>Note: </B> A VM segment may be locked more than once.  The VMM system
     maintains, for each segment, a lock count (_xvlockcount()) which is
     incremented each time you lock the segment and decremented each time you
     unlock the segment.  A segment is not physically unlocked until its lock
     count is zero.  You must eventually unlock all VM segments with
     _xvunlock().

     <B>Warning! </B> Do not leave a VM segment locked unnecessarily.  Because
     all locked segments reside in conventional memory, the more of them you
     lock the greater is the chance of exhausting conventional memory.
     Therefore, always unlock a VM segment with _xvunlock() when you are not
     actively accessing it.  Typically, this will mean locking and unlocking
     the same VM segment several times within one function call.

     If you have to lock a VM segment for an extended period of time, use
     _xvwire().  This function places the VM segment in an area of the swap
     space that least inhibits the VMM system.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.  Error conditions:</B>  If there is not enough VM swap space available
        for the segment to be loaded into conventional memory, the system
        raises an internal error and halts.

     <B>.  Garbage collection:</B>  The VMM system may take up to several seconds
        to lock a VM segment if locking it triggers garbage collection.  Use
        _xvwire() for routines that require fast access to a buffer.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This example allocates a segment with _xvalloc() and locks it
        using _xvlock().  After a string is copied into the locked segment,
        the segment is unlocked and freed (with _xvunlock() and _xvfree()):

           Boolean bResult = FALSE;

           if (hSegment = _xvalloc(strlen(spSrc) + 1, 0))
              {
              spString = _xvlock(hSegment);
              if (spString != NULL)
                 {
                 strcpy(spString, spSrc);

                 .
                 . &lt;statements&gt;
                 .

                 bResult = TRUE;

                 _xvunlock(hSegment);
                 }
              _xvfree(hSegment);
              }

           return (bResult);
        }
