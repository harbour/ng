<B>ClipMore seems to be including DELETED records!  Why?</B>

For performance reasons, cmFilter() always assumes that SET DELETED is OFF.
In other words, ClipMore ignores the SET DELETED setting.

Records that are deleted will be included in the Filter RecordList.  When
the deleted record is actually read, it will then be determined that it is
deleted and will drop out of the RecordList.

This can result in some perplexing key counts.  Consider the following:

    use demo
    index on last to last
    index on first to first
    set index to last, first

    cmfilter("last = 'Smith' .and. first = 'Amy'")
    ? cmKeyCount()      &amp;&amp; returns 29 (which includes one deleted record)

Then you do a TBrowse and the deleted record is read, it is eliminated from
the RecordList, so cmKeyCount() goes to 28.

To get around this, explicitly add ".and. !deleted()" to your condition.

    cmfilter("&lt;condition&gt; .and. !deleted()")
