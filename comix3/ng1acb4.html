<B>What's the most efficient way to eliminate deleted records?</B>

The elimDel() function provided below will quickly eliminate all deleted
records:

    *   Quickly eliminate all deleted records from any existing filter
    function elimDel()
        local rlp

        *   If we have a filter RecordList (nothing to do if we don't)
        if (rlGetFilter() &lt;&gt; 0)

            *   Get a RecordList of all deleted records (only keys in delOnly
            *   are those for deleted records)
            rlSetLoHi(rlp := rlNew(), NIL, NIL, ordNumber("delOnly"))

            *   NOT this to get has only records which are NOT deleted
            rlp := rlNot(rlp)

            *   AND with filter condition, so we have only NOT deleted recs
            rlAnd(rlGetFilter(), rlp)
        endif
    return nil

In order to use this function, you will need to set up the delOnly tag:

    *   Set up the index
    index on ' ' tag delOnly for deleted()

Here's an example of using this function:

    cmFilter("age &lt; 25 .and. last = 'J'")
    elimDel()

CmFilter() will quickly find only those records meeting the condition.
ElimDel() will then eliminate all deleted records from the Filter
RecordList.

You can set up your own function which will automatically do this (or even
modify the source for cmFilter() provided in cmFilt.prg).  For example:

    function myFilter(cCond)
        cmFilter(cCond)
        elimDel()
    return nil
