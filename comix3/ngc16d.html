<B>rlNewQuery()</B>          Create a RecordList of recs meeting the condition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlNewQuery(cQuery) -&gt; rlResult

<B>Arguments</B>

    cQuery is the condition which records should meet (as a character
    string).

<B>Returns</B>

    rlNewQuery() returns a RecordList of records which meet the condition by
    scanning available records.  This RecordList may contain Maybe's.

<B>Description</B>

    rlNewQuery() analyzes the condition, matches up parts of the condition
    with indexes and determines which records meet the condition by scanning
    indexes.

    This is a very powerful function in that it handles matching up parts of
    the condition with indexes automatically.

    However, unlike other RecordList functions, this function can return a
    RecordList which contains Maybe's (see the description under
    cmDoLinear()).

    You can use rlMaybeEval() to clear off any Maybe's (and make them Yes or
    No).

    rlOptLevel() will return the level of optimization achieved by this
    function (full optimization, partial optimization, or no optimization).

<B>Example</B>

    use demo index age
<B>    rl := rlNewQuery("age &gt;= 25 .and. age &lt;= 30")</B>
    ? "Records meeting condition: "
    curRec := 0
    do while ((curRec := rlNextRecno(curRec)) != 0)
        ? curRec
    enddo
    rlDestroy(rl)

<B>Example</B>

    *   Use demo (only index is age)
    use demo index age

    *   No index on salary, so can't optimize that"
<B>    rl := rlNewQuery("age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt;= 25000")</B>
    ? "Approximate count: ", rlCount(rl)

    *   Clear off the Maybe's
    rlMaybeEval(rl, {|| age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt;= 25000})

    *   Now give the exact count
    ? "      Exact count: ", rlCount(rl)
