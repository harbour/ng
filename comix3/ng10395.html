<B>Overview</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides a model of how ClipMore operates.  This is intended to
give you a conceptual framework so that you can best utilize ClipMore's
capabilities.  The Function Reference chapter covers the details of
ClipMore.

ClipMore is intended to speed up selective access to records.  Selective
access means those cases where you want to only access records which meet a
FOR condition, FILTER condition or fall within a SEEK/WHILE range.

<B>How Clipper Operates Alone</B>

Consider a specific case where you have done a SET FILTER TO, and are then
doing a dbedit().  When you press Down Arrow to move to the next record,
Clipper will look at the next record and determine if it meets the filter
condition.  If it does, it stops at that record.  However, if the record
doesn't meet the condition, Clipper skips to the next record, and repeats
the process until it finds a record which meets the condition.

This identical process is followed whenever you use a FOR condition. Clipper
simply skips through the records until it finds a record which meets the FOR
condition.

If almost all records meet the condition the time required is negligible.
However, if only 1 out of a 100 records meets the FILTER (or FOR) condition,
it takes a considerable length of time to get the next record.

This problem can be so bad that a filter condition is considered taboo in
many circles.  ClipMore alleviates this problem.

<B>How ClipMore Operates</B>

ClipMore uses all available indexes to determine which records meet the
condition (it does not need to access the actual records).  This capability
is provided by the cmFilter() function.  For example, in Clipper, you might
specify:

    set filter to &lt;condition&gt;

Using ClipMore, you would instead specify:

    cmFilter("&lt;condition&gt;")

The cmFilter() function parses your condition, determines what indexes are
available, and uses the indexes to determine exactly what records meet the
condition.

ClipMore now knows which records meet the condition.  So, whenever you skip,
ClipMore only stops on records which meet the condition.  No time is wasted
retrieving records which don't meet the condition.

So, each time Clipper skips to another record it finds a record which meets
the condition.  No time is wasted going through 100 records which don't meet
the condition.  This is how ClipMore achieves its performance gain.

The cmFilter() function has the identical effect of a SET FILTER TO, but is
_much_ faster.

<B>Summary</B>

Clipper (without ClipMore) inspects each record to determine which records
meet the condition.  If there is no master index, the records are examined
in record number order.  If there is a master index, the records are
examined in the order specified by the master index.

ClipMore improves Clipper's performance through the cmFilter() function.
cmFilter() analyzes your condition and uses all available indexes to rapidly
determine the records that meet the condition.  This process is fast because
the actual database records need not be retrieved;  instead the information
in the available indexes is used directly to determine which records meet
the condition.

ClipMore then helps Clipper skip directly to records which meet the
condition; not time is wasted accessing records which don't meet the
condition.
