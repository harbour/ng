<B>Appendix B: Error Codes</B>

There are only a few errors which are produced by ClipMore.


<B>9001: Invalid RecordList</B>

This is a runtime error which occurs when you attempt to reference an
invalid RecordList.

There are two ways this can happen:

1.  Attempt to reference an invalid or destroy'd RecordList.

2.  Destroy the Filter RecordList.

As an example of the first error, consider the following code:

    rl1 := rlNew()                  &amp;&amp; AOK
    rlResult := rlAnd(rl1, rl2)     &amp;&amp; BAD!!! Reference to invalid rl (rl2)

The rlAnd() will produce the error because you have referenced an
uninitialized RecordList (rl2).

As another example of the first error, consider the following code:

    rl := rlNew()                   &amp;&amp; AOK
    rlDestroy(rl)                   &amp;&amp; AOK
    return rlNot(rl)                &amp;&amp; BAD!!! Reference to destroyed rl

In this case, rl _was_ a valid RecordList, but has been destroyed (by the
call the rlDestroy()).  You may not reference a RecordList once it is
destroyed.

As another example of this type of error (invalid Filter RecordList),
consider this example:

    rl := rlGetFilter()             &amp;&amp; Get the filter
    rlSet(rl, 50)                   &amp;&amp; Add record 50 (AOK)
    rlSet(rl, 100)                  &amp;&amp; Add record 100 (AOK)
    rlDestroy(rl)                   &amp;&amp; BAD!!!  Destroyed the Filter
                                    &amp;&amp; RecordList _but_ no immediate error
    skip                            &amp;&amp; This line will error out

The rlDestroy() causes the Filter RecordList to be destroyed.  However,
since ClipMore still owns it, it will attempt to reference a RecordList
which has been destroyed.

However, the error does not show up until the skip, when ClipMore attempts
to reference the destroyed RecordList.


<B>9002: Couldn't Resize RecordList</B>

This error should never occur.  It indicates that an attempt to resize the
RecordList failed.  Please report any such occurrence with the example code
which caused the problem to Technical Support, preferably via BBS.


<B>9003: Invalid Node Type</B>

This error should never occur.  It indicates an internal error in the
ClipMore's condition parser.  Please report any such occurrence with the
example code and specific filter condition which caused the problem to
Technical Support, preferably via BBS.


<B>9004: Filter Expression Too Long</B>

This error indicates that the filter expression was over 2044 characters.
This is the maximum length condition which ClipMore can process.  If you
conditions which exceed this length, we recommend that you break the
condition apart, pass the separate portions to rlNewQuery(), and then
rlAnd()/rlOr() the results together to get the full result.


<B>9900: Demo Limit Exceeded</B>

    This error applies only to the demo version of ClipMore.  Currently
    there is only one limit:

    o   No more than two database files can be open simultaneously.

    Attempting to open more than two database files simultaneously
    (regardless of RDD) will result in this error being generated. 
    Also, please note that APPEND FROM implicitly causes a database to
    be opened.


<B>Other</B>

The other runtime errors which will show up are passing an invalid condition
to cmFilter().  This will show up at run time.
