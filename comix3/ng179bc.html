<B>Appendix C: Technical Support</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We appreciate your use of Loadstone's products and want you to get the most
out of our software.  We will provide Technical Support to the single user
who registered the product.

You must be registered before contacting Technical Support.  If you
purchased directly from LoadStone you are automatically registered.
Otherwise, mail or fax (305/572-7196) the User Registration card to us.

<B>We ask that you please take a couple minutes to read the following Appendix</B>
<B>before contacting Technical Support.</B>


    <B>Overview</B>

We are glad to help, but at the same time we sincerely ask that you conserve
our support resources by:

o   Checking out the obvious on your own
o   Being well-organized
o   Being specific and concise

This lets us provide you with top-notch technical support people while still
remaining cost-competitive.  Thanks in advance for your help!


    <B>Tech Support Tips</B>

o   If your question is a "Will it ..." or "Can I ..." type of question,
    please try it yourself before contacting us.

o   If you get a specific error message/number, consult "Appendix B:  Error
    Codes" and see if the suggestions there resolve the problem.

o   If you cannot find an answer in Appendix B or you have a more general
    question, please consult the Norton Guide "Questions?/Answers" section.
    The most frequently asked questions have already been answered there.

o   If the problem still persists with the latest version, please have the
    following information ready when you contact Technical Support:

    o   Serial Number (on the distribution diskette)

    o   Version # (can be obtained adding the following lines to your
        program):
    
            ? cmxVersion(2)
            ? cmVersion(2)
            wait

    o   What _exactly_ are you trying to do?

    o   What _exactly_ is going wrong?


    <B>Bug Reports</B>

This product has undergone extensive testing, but errors in the software
and/or documentation may be discovered.

We work very hard to provide bug-free software and have obtained an
excellent reputation in this area.  This reputation is due in large part to
the excellent help of our clients.

Please report any problems to us rather than letting them slide or working
around them.  We will do our best to get any problems handled quickly and
terminatedly.  Thanks!

o   In order to fix a bug, we need a reproducible example.

o   We ask that you please try to isolate the bug to a simple example, and
    then upload the example to the BBS.

    The fastest resolution to your problem will be obtained by sending us a
    test program which clearly demonstrates the bug.

o   In some cases, you may not be able to reproduce the bug in a simple
    example.  If this is the case, please let us know about the incorrect
    behavior you are experiencing, giving us any information you feel is
    relevant.

    We can sometimes create a reproducible example ourselves based on the
    information you give us and/or give you a similar example showing the
    product functioning correctly.


    <B>Contacting Technical Support</B>
