ClipMore gives Clipper applications the power of state of the art query
optimization.  This technology can add blazing speed to your applications,
and opens new realms of possibilities for Clipper developers.

ClipMore automatically uses all available indexes to determine which records
meet a condition without accessing the database.  ClipMore also provides
Linear Optimization (which works with the index optimization) and can
substantially improve performance even when no indexes are available for
optimization.

Typical speed improvements for selective access are over 10 to 1.  In some
cases, you may get a phenomenal 1000 to 1.  In addition to raw speed,
ClipMore can make the application development process simpler and faster.
You simply specify a condition, and the system automatically accesses
records as efficiently as possible.

ClipMore 3.0 now provides developers with low-level functions for the
ultimate in optimizer flexibility.

Clipper, when used with ClipMore (and Comix), provides the most powerful
development platform available for xBASE applications.

ClipMore is LAN-ready, and can be distributed royalty free as part of your
compiled applications (subject to the terms of the license agreement).

ClipMore gives you the power to create better solutions to user needs and
can make your development efforts simpler, faster and more profitable.

<B>NOTE:</B> ClipMore 3.0 provides a series of functions called RecordList
      functions (all these function names begin "rl").  These are intended
      to provide you with the ultimate in flexibility.  However, these
      functions _are_ complex and are _not_ necessary to use ClipMore.

      We strongly recommend that you work with "cm" functions first, and
      then progress to the "rl" functions when you require it.
