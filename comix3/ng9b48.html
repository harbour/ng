<B>rlMaybeEval()</B>         Remove Maybe's from a RecordList
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlMaybeEval(rl, bBlock) -&gt; nRecs

<B>Arguments</B>

    rl is the RecordList from which Maybe's are to be removed.

    bBlock is the CodeBlock to be evaluated for each Maybe record.  It
    should return a logical (.T. if the record meets the condition, .F.
    otherwise).

<B>Returns</B>

    rlMaybeEval() returns the number of Maybe records visited.

<B>Description</B>

    rlMaybeEval() removes Maybe's from a RecordList (makes them either Yes
    or No).

    rlNewQuery() will return a RecordList containing Maybe's if the
    condition is not fully optimizable (see the discussion under
    cmDoLinear()).

    rlMaybeEval() will evaluate bBlock for all records which are Maybe's in
    rl.  This allows you to evaluate the condition for each record, and
    determine if it meets the condition or not.

    Note that if the RecordList has no Maybe's, then this function does
    nothing.

    The source code for cmDoLinear() gives you a good example of the use of
    this function.

<B>Example</B>

    *   Use demo (only index is age)
    use demo index age

    *   No index on salary, so can't optimize that"
    rl := rlNewQuery("age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt;= 25000")
    ? "Approximate count: ", rlCount(rl)

    *   Clear off the Maybe's
<B>    rlMaybeEval(rl, {|| age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt;= 25000})</B>

    *   Now give the exact count
    ? "      Exact count: ", rlCount(rl)
