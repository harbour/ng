<B>cmFiltCount()</B>         Get the number of records which meet the condition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    cmFiltCount() -&gt; nMatches

<B>Arguments</B>

    None.

<B>Returns</B>

    cmFiltCount() returns the number of records which meet the filter
    condition which has been set by cmFilter().

<B>Description</B>

    cmFiltCount() returns the number of records which meet the filter
    condition set up by cmFilter().  cmFilter() is used if it is called
    explicitly _or_ if cm52.ch has been #include'd into a file and a SET
    FILTER TO is used.

    This function will force Linear Optimization to be performed so that the
    return value is fully accurate (however, please note that DELETED
    records are included as part of the count unless you have explicitly
    added !deleted() as part of the condition).

    cmFiltCount() does _not_ obey any index scope in effect.  It returns the
    number of records which meet the condition independent of any index
    scope.  cmKeyCount(), however, will return the the number of records
    which meet the condition _and_ fall within the scope of the current
    master index.

<B>Example</B>

    use demo index last, lastcall

    *   Select down to these records
    cmFilter("last = 'J' .and. lastcall &gt;= ctod('1/1/80')")

    *   Say how many meet the condition
<B>    ? cmFiltCount(), " records meet the condition: " + dbFilter()</B>

    *   Now list them out
    list last, lastcall
