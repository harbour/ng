<B>How can I make cmFilter() find EOF() and BOF() faster?</B>

ClipMore can sometimes take a long time to determine that EOF() or BOF() has
been reached.

For example:

    use demo index last
    cmFilter("last = 'J'")
    go top                      &amp;&amp; May take a little while

Since there is an index available on last, ClipMore will quickly determine
which records meet the condition.

However, when doing the go top (since you are in last name order), you will
have some dead time while ClipMore skips through the A's, the B's, etc.
until it reaches the first J.  Similarly once you skip past the last J,
ClipMore you will have some dead time while ClipMore runs through the rest
of the index (i.e, the K's, the L's, the M's, etc.).

In general, this occurs when the filter condition is very restrictive on the
master index.  If the master index had been on AGE, then you probably would
never see any delay.

There are two possible solutions:

    1)  SET SCOPE on the master index when it is referenced in the
        condition.

    2)  Put the database in a different order (natural or some other
        index).  This eliminates the "grouping" of non-matching records.
