<B>rlOptLevel()            Get optimization level rlNewQuery() achieved</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlOptLevel() -&gt; nOptLevel

<B>Arguments</B>

    None.

<B>Returns</B>

    A numeric result which is one of the following values:

    2:  Fully Optimizable
    1:  Partially Optimizable
    0:  Not Optimizable

<B>Description</B>

    rlOptLevel() returns the level of optimization which was achieved by the
    last call to rlNewQuery().  Since cmFilter() calls rlNewQuery(), this
    function will also return the level of optimization achieved by the last
    call to cmFilter().

    The three levels of optimization possible are (see examples below for
    more information):

    <B>Fully Optimizable</B> which means that the condition was fully resolved
    by looking at the indexes (i.e., all records meeting the condition were
    determined solely by looking at the indexes).

    <B>Partially Optimizable</B> which means that part of the condition was
    resolved by looking at indexes, but part of the condition could not be
    resolved.

    <B>Not Optimizable</B> which means that no part of the condition could be
    resolved by looking at indexes.

<B>Example</B>

    *   Assume that there is no structural index, so only indexes explicitly
    *   brought into use are available for optimization
    use demo

    set index to age, last
    rl := rlNewQuery("age = 30 .and. last = 'J'")
    ? rlOptLevel()              &amp;&amp; Will return 2 (fully optimizable), since
                                &amp;&amp; condition can be fully resolved just by
                                &amp;&amp; looking at the indexes
    rlDestroy(rl)

    set index to age
    rl := rlNewQuery("age = 30 .and. last = 'J'")
    ? rlOptLevel()              &amp;&amp; Will return 1 (partially optimizable),
                                &amp;&amp; since "age = 30" can be resolved using
                                &amp;&amp; index on age, but "last = 'J'" can't be
                                &amp;&amp; (no index)
    rlDestroy(rl)

    set index to
    rl := rlNewQuery("age = 30 .and. last = 'J'")
    ? rlOptLevel()              &amp;&amp; Will return 0 (not optimizable), since
                                &amp;&amp; neither the age condition nor the last
                                &amp;&amp; condition can be resolved by using
                                &amp;&amp; indexes
    rlDestroy(rl)
