<B>rlAnd()</B>               AND together two RecordList's
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlAnd(rl1, rl2) -&gt; rlResult

<B>Arguments</B>

    rl1 &amp; rl2 are the two RecordList's to be AND'd together.

<B>Returns</B>

    rl1 (AND'd with rl2).

<B>Description</B>

    rlAnd() AND's together two RecordList's so that only records contained
    in both RecordList's are contained in the result.

    rl2 is destroyed by this function.  The returned RecordList is actually
    rl1 (with its bit-maps properly AND'd).  This saves the the developer
    from having to explicitly destroy the AND'd recordList.

<B>Example</B>

    rl1 := rlNew(10)                &amp;&amp; Set up rl1 with recs 5 &amp; 7
    rlSet(rl1, 5)
    rlSet(rl1, 7)
    ? rlCount(rl1)                  &amp;&amp; Will return 2

    rl2 := rlNew(10)
    rlSet(rl2, 5)
    rlSet(rl2, 9)
    ? rlCount(rl2)                  &amp;&amp; Will return 2

<B>    rl1 := rlAnd(rl1, rl2)          &amp;&amp; AND them together</B>
    ? rlCount(rl1)                  &amp;&amp; Will return 1 (because only record
                                    &amp;&amp; 5 was in both RecordList's)

    rlDestroy(rl1)                  &amp;&amp; Now clean up (rl2 was destroyed
                                    &amp;&amp; by the rlAnd() above)

<B>Example</B>

    rl1 := rlNew(10)
    rlSet(rl1, 5)
    rl2 := rlNew(10)
    rlSet(rl2, 5)
    rlSet(rl2, 7)
    ? rlCount(rl1), " records are in the first RecordList"
    ? rlCount(rl2), " records are in the second RecordList"
<B>    rlResult = rlAnd(rl1, rl2)</B>
    ? rlCount(rlResult), " records are in both RecordList's"

    ? (rlResult == rl1)             &amp;&amp; Will return .T.
    ? (rlResult == rl2)             &amp;&amp; Will return .F.
    rlDestroy(rlResult)
