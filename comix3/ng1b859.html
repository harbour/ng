<B>rlNewQuery()/rlSetFilter() don't seem to work!  Why?</B>

rlNewQuery() determines records that meet the condition based ONLY on
available indexes and it does NOT look at the database.

rlSetFilter() uses ONLY the RecordList to determine which records to
access.

Since it is possible that rlNewQuery() may not have the indexes it needs to
fully determine which records meet the condition, it can return a RecordList
which contains more records than actually meet the condition.

For example, consider the following code:

    use demo index age
    rlp := rlNewQuery("age &gt; 25 .and. salary &gt; 30000")
    rlSetFilter(rlp)
    list age, salary

rlNewQuery() will return only records with age &gt; 25 _but_ the salary part of
the condition is not resolved.  All records with age &gt; 25 will be included
in the returned RecordList.  These records are known as "Maybe's".  They
_may_ meet the condition or they _may_ not (based on whether or not their
salary is OK).

cmFilter() uses rlNewQuery()/rlSetFilter(), _but_ first does a dbSetFilter()
of the condition.  This is done so that each record accessed is checked
against the full explicit condition;  this eliminates any non-matching
"maybe" records when they are read in.

If you want to use rlNewQuery()/rlSetFilter() (and the condition is not
fully optimizable) give dbSetFilter() a semantically equivalent condition. 
For example:

    dbSetFilter({|| myUDF()}, "myUDF()")
    rl := rlNewQuery(&lt;condition&gt;)
    rlSetFilter(rl)

    function myUDF()
    return (&lt;condition&gt;)

Since rlNewQuery() can handle much larger conditions than cmFilter()
(cmFilter() is limited by Clipper's macro compiler), this technique is
sometimes useful.

Please note that dbSetFilter() must be called before rlSetFilter(), because
any existing Filter RecordList for the workarea is discarded when
dbSetFilter() is called.
