<B>rlNot()</B>               NOT a RecordList
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlNot(rl) -&gt; rlResult

<B>Arguments</B>

    rl is the RecordList to be NOT'd.

<B>Returns</B>

    rlNot() returns the resultant RecordList.  (This is the same as rl with
    the bit-maps of the RecordList appropriately NOT'd).

<B>Description</B>

    rlNot() NOT's the RecordList.  All Yes's in the RecordList are turned
    into No's, and all No's in the RecordList are turned into Yes's.

    Please note that if your RecordList has Maybe's (e.g., a RecordList
    returned by rlNewQuery() without a fully optimizable condition), Maybe's
    stay as Maybe's.

<B>Example</B>

    rl := rlNew(100)
    ? rlCount(rl)                   &amp;&amp; Returns 0
<B>    rl := rlNot(rl)</B>
    ? rlCount(rl)                   &amp;&amp; Returns 100
