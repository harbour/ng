<B>Appendix D: Using the BBS &amp; Obtaining Patches</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The BBS phone # is: (305) 741 - 6872.  You can connect at up to 21.6K (N,8,1
settings).

We strongly recommend that you use our BBS for Tech Support, as it allows
the easy transmission of files, problem examples, etc., and automatically
makes questions and answers available for other users.

You must be registered before you will given full access to the BBS.  If you
purchased directly from LoadStone you are automatically registered.
Otherwise, mail or fax (305/572-7196) the User Registration card to us.


<B>Understanding The BBS</B>

The BBS is divided into a number of "conferences."

There is one conference for each product.

Each conference has its own set of messages and its own set of files.  There
is a conference for Comix, a conference for ClipMore/CMX, etc.

To access the messages and files for a conference, you must first join (move
to) the conference.

The J command allows you to join a conference (J is short for "Join
Conference").  The J command will give you a list of conferences available,
from which you will select one.

Once in a conference, you can see all messages and files which are available
for that conference.

When you have questions about a specific product or want to access files for
a specific product, you should first join the conference for that product
(using the J command).

The BBS displays online menus and help.  It is relatively easy to use. 
Please feel free to play around with the BBS to get comfortable with it.


<B>Quick Tips to Make Your BBS Use Faster</B>

    <B>Logging onto the BBS for the first time:</B>

        1.  Make certain that you are registered (either purchased direct
            from LoadStone or mailed/faxed us your registration card)
        2.  Have your serial # ready (located on the distribution diskette)
        3.  Fill out the registration as a new user
        4.  Leave a comment to the SYSOP (using the C command) asking to be
            granted access to the BBS

        Access will usually be granted within a few business hours.

    <B>Downloading a Patch:</B>

        1.  Log onto the BBS 
        2.  J (join the conference for which you want patches) 
        3.  F (file directory listing patches) 
        4.  D (download the file) _or_ DB (download batch of files)

    <B>Finding Messages on a specific topic:</B>

        1.  Log onto the BBS 
        2.  TS ALL 1+ &lt;topic&gt; (replace &lt;topic&gt; with what you want to search
            for, e.g. FLEXFILE)

        We recommend this as an interactive process since your initial guess
        at &lt;topic&gt; may not find anything.

    <B>Sending a message:</B>

        Prepare your message offline in a text editor making certain that:

        o   It doesn't contain two blank lines in a row
        o   The length of each line is 72 characters or less

        When you have composed your message:

        1.  Log onto the BBS.
        2.  J (join the conference appropriate for your message)
        3.  E (enter the message)
        4.  Type in the subject, and address it to SYSOP
        5.  U (upload the message)
        6.  Use your comm program to upload an ASCII file
        7.  Press Z and ENTER when the upload is complete

    <B>Receiving Replies (Messages sent to you):</B>

        1.  Log onto the BBS 
        2.  R ALL Y S Z (reads all new messages sent to you in all
            conferences and places them in a single file for download)
        3.  Use your communications software to download the file

    <B>Getting all new messages (sent to you or anyone else):</B>

        1.  R ALL S Z (reads all new messages in all conferences, and places
            them in a single file for download)
        2.  Use your communications software to download the file

    <B>Getting _all_ messages ever sent on the BBS:</B>
