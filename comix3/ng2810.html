<B>cmDoLinear()</B>          Perform Linear Optimization/eliminate maybe's
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    cmDoLinear() -&gt; NIL

<B>Arguments</B>

    None.

<B>Returns</B>

    NIL.

<B>Description</B>

    cmDoLinear() performs Linear Optimization.  Basically, this process
    minimally scans the database in order to isolate only records which
    fully meet the condition.

    As an example, consider the condition: "(age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt; 25000)
    .or. last = 'J'", and suppose that we have an indexes on "age" and
    "last", but do _not_ have an index on salary.

    In this case, ClipMore will be able to to isolate the records meeting
    the "age" condition and the "last" condition using indexes, but will not
    be able to determine the records that meet the salary condition.  This
    will result in the Filter RecordList having Maybe's (since records
    meeting the age condition may or may not meet the salary condition).

    If you execute cmDoLinear(), the database will be minimally scanned to
    eliminate all the Maybe's.  The Filter RecordList will then only contain
    records which do in fact meet the full condition.

    This process can, however, take substantial time based on the number
    of Maybe's in the RecordList.
    
    If the Filter RecordList has no Maybe's (i.e., the filter condition was
    fully optimizable), then this function will return immediately because
    there is nothing to do.

    If you have Linear Optimization turned on (cmSetLinear(.t.)), then this
    function will automatically be invoked by cmFilter() and cmReFilter().

<B>Example</B>

    use demo index age

    *   Do the filtering (using available indexes)
    cmFilter("age &lt;= 25 .and. salary &lt;= 30000")

<B>    cmDoLinear()                        &amp;&amp; Quickly remove the Maybe's</B>
