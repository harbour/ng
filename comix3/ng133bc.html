<B>Installation</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes installing and linking with ClipMore.  It assumes
that you are also using the Comix RDD.

If you are new to the Comix RDD, we suggest that you first install and use
Comix.  Then, once you are comfortable in using Comix, come back and use
ClipMore.

<B>Files</B>

All ClipMore files are located in the \CLIPMORE directory.  All
subdirectories mentioned are contained in this directory.  The first files
for ClipMore are:

o   cm.ng

    This is the Norton Guide for ClipMore.

o   cm.lnk

    This is the recommended link script when working with Blinker.

The following files need to be available to use ClipMore.  Copy them from
the \52 directory.

o   cm52.ch

    This is the header file which automatically maps SET FILTER TO commands
    to the optimized version.

o   cm52.lib

    This is the library file which contains the ClipMore optimizer.

o   cm52.obj

    This is the object file which makes certain that certain ClipMore
    functions are linked in preference to the Comix (non-optimizing)
    versions of the same functions.

<B>Linking</B>

    <B>Overview</B>

In order to use ClipMore you will need to link with cm52.lib.  For example,
suppose you have a simple test program, test and are using RTLink.  Your
link line would be:

    rtlink /stack:7168 file test, cm52, cmx52 lib cm52, cmx52

Please note that <B>ClipMore is specified _BEFORE_ Comix</B> (both in the
object file listing and the library listing).  This is necessary because
ClipMore replaces some of the functions in Comix.  In order that the linker
use ClipMore's functions in preference to the Comix versions, you must
specify ClipMore before Comix.

<B>There is a simple rule in linking with ClipMore: ClipMore BEFORE Comix.</B>
If you do not do this, you will get incorrect behavior and non-optimized
performance.

Note that <B>the stack size is increased by 3K</B> over the default.  This is
the maximum which ClipMore/Comix will use.

    <B>Blinker</B>

For Blinker users, here's what your basic link script might look like to use
ClipMore with Comix:

    OUTPUT test
    <B>STACK 7168</B>
    BEGINAREA
        FILE test
        <B>FILE cm52</B>
        <B>ALLOCATE cm52</B>
        FILE cmx52
        ALLOCATE cmx52
    ENDAREA
    @cm.lnk
    @cmx.lnk

<B>Important: ClipMore _must_ be listed before Comix.  Failure to do so will</B>
<B>           result in incorrect behavior and non-optimized performance.</B>
