This chapter is a catch-all for items not covered elsewhere in this manual.

<B>Known Limitations</B>

These are known limitations of the current version of ClipMore:

o   You cannot reference locals or statics.  See the cm2Str() function
    for a clean way to work around this.

o   You cannot reference array elements.  See the cm2Str() function for a
    clean way to work around this.


<B>Multi-User Considerations</B>

When cmFilter() is called, it effectively takes a "snap-shot" of the
database at that point in time.  This means that records which didn't meet
the condition when cmFilter() was executed will _not_ be reexamined, and
will never be considered to meet the filter condition.

As an example of this behavior consider the following:

Time 1:

    Record 100:     Bobo    50

Time 2 (Workstation A):

    use demo index age
    cmFilter("age = 49")
    (record 100 does NOT meet the condition)

Time 3 (Workstation B):

    use demo index age
    goto 100
    rlock()
    replace age with 49
    unlock

Time 4 (Workstation A):

    Still won't display record 100 (since it didn't meet the condition
    at Time 2 when the condition was evaluated).

Based on _lots_ of experience, this is _not_ an important issue in most
cases.  This is similar to what you encounter when you display records in a
TBrowse.  The records displayed are a "snap-shot" from an earlier time.

In the event that this is critical for your application, we recommend that
you define a user key which allows them to "refresh" their snap-shot of
the database.  For example:

    function cmRefresh()

            //  Re-evaluate the current condition
        cmFilter(dbFilter())
    return nil
