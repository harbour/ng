<B>cmKeyCount() includes deleted records!  Why?</B>

cmKeyCount() counts the number of records in the index which meet the filter
condition.  The setting of SET DELETED is ignored.

If you want different behavior add ".and. !deleted()" to your condition
explicitly.  For example:

    cmFilter("&lt;condition&gt; .and. !deleted()")
    ? cmKeyCount()  &amp;&amp; returns the number of keys in the index that 
                    &amp;&amp; meet the condition (and therefore aren't deleted).
