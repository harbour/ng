<B>SET FILTER</B>           Rapidly isolate records meeting a condition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    SET FILTER TO
        [&lt;condition&gt;]
        [NOOPTIMIZE]

<B>Arguments</B>

    &lt;condition&gt; is the condition which records must meet in order to be
    visible.

    NOOPTIMIZE is an optional parameter.  If specified, then optimization
    will _not_ be used.  Instead, the SET FILTER TO will done as normal.

<B>Description</B>

    You must #include cm52.ch in order to use the ClipMore version of this
    command.

    ClipMore's SET FILTER TO behaves like the standard SET FILTER TO with
    the difference that it is far faster.  It is a command implementation of
    the cmFilter() function.

    In cases where ClipMore cannot optimize the condition (such as using
    local variables in the condition), you will either want to assign the
    local's to private's, or use the NOOPTIMIZE clause to prevent
    optimization from being used.

    See cmFilter() for a more complete description of the process used to
    implement and optimize SET FILTER TO.

<B>Example</B>

    *   Restrict to these people
<B>    set filter to age &lt;= 25 .and. last = 'J'</B>

    *   List in last name order
    set order tag last
    list age, last, first

    *   List in first name order
    set order tag first
    list age, last, first

<B>Example</B>

    function localFilter()
    local loSal := 50000
    local hiSal := 75000

    *   Use NOOPTIMIZE because you can't reference local's in a condition
<B>    set filter to salary &gt;= loSal .and. salary &lt;= hiSal NOOPTIMIZE</B>

    *   Do whatever operations
    ...

    *   Clear the filter condition
<B>    set filter to</B>
    return
    
<B>Example</B>

    function privateFilter()
    local loSal := 50000
    local hiSal := 75000

    *   Set up privates as "dummy" variables so ClipMore can optimize
    private _loSal, _hiSal
    _loSal := 50000
    _hiSal := 75000

    *   Allow to be optimized (since we're using privates)
<B>    set filter to salary &gt;= _loSal .and. salary &lt;= _hiSal</B>

    *   Do whatever operations
    ...

    *   Clear the filter condition
<B>    set filter to</B>
    return
