<B>cmReFilter()</B>          Get/set smart filter setting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    cmSmartFilter( [lNew] ) -&gt; lPrev

<B>Arguments</B>

    lNew is an optional parameter.  If provided and .T., smart filtering
    will be done.  If .F., then smart filtering will not be done.

    By default, this flag is .T. (i.e., smart filtering is done).

<B>Returns</B>

    cmSmartFilter() returns the previous setting of the smart filter flag.

<B>Description</B>

    By default ClipMore employs a technique known as smart filtering.  This
    means that ClipMore "remembers" whether or not a record meets the
    filter condition.  Once ClipMore retrieves a record and finds it does
    not meet the condition, it never again gets that record.  (Technically
    speaking, it removes the record from the Filter RecordList).

    In almost all cases, this is desirable behavior and gives the best
    possible performance (even in cases where the condition is completely
    unoptimizable).  However, in some cases involving complex relations,
    this behavior is not desirable.

    cmSmartFilter() provides control over or not ClipMore uses smart
    filtering.

    <B>TIP:  Do not use this function or turn smart filtering off unless you</B>
          <B>know you need to.</B>

<B>Example</B>

    use demo

    cmFilter("age = 30")

        /*  By default, ClipMore will use smart filtering.  This means that
            even though the condition above was unoptimizable, the Browse
            will still be much faster, since we only retrieve a non-matching
            record once!
         */
    browse()

    lSave := cmSmartFilter(.f.)         &amp;&amp; Turn smart filtering off
    cmFilter("age = 30")

        /*  This time, ClipMore won't use smart filtering since we turned it
            off.  ClipMore will continue to retrieve records, even if they
            didn't match the first time we retrieved them.
         */
    browse()
