<B>When should I use INDEX ON .. FOR vs. cmFilter()?</B>

Usually, the only time you would want to create a conditional index is when
you want to keep the index updated and available.  For example, if you want
to keep track of records that are not paid and want records to drop out of
that index as soon as they are marked paid, then a conditional index is
ideal.

For temporary (ad hoc) conditions, cmFilter() is faster than creating a
conditional index because it only reads indexes, it does not have to create
them.

There is one relatively obscure exception to consider (don't worry about
this until you actually experience a slowdown).  If only a very small
percentage (0.1% or less) of records meet the condition, then you may want
to create a conditional index for faster record to record access.  Here's
why:

ClipMore skips by getting the next record number from the controlling index
and checking to see if that record is in the Filter RecordList.  If it isn't
then ClipMore gets the next record number from the index, etc. until it
finds one that is in the Filter RecordList.

If only 0.1% of the records meet the condition, ClipMore may have to go
through 1000 keys in the index in order to find the next matching record. 
This can take some time.

With a conditional index, however, the next record in the index always meets
the condition, so record to record skipping is very fast.
