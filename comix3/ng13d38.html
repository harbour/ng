<B>Quick Start</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <B>Really Quick Start</B>

Make sure you've installed ClipMore (as described in the Installation
Chapter).

Create a temporary directory.

Copy a:\util\dbgen.exe (a test database generator on your ClipMore diskette)
into the temporary directory.

Write a quick program, test.prg:

    use demo
    if (ordNumber("last") == 0)
        index on last tag last
    endif
    if (ordNumber("age") == 0)
        index on age tag age
    endif

    cmFilter("last = 'J'")
    ? cmFiltCount(), " matches"

    set order to tag age
    list age, last

Now compile and link it:

    clipper test
    rtlink /stack:7168 file test,cm52,cmx52 lib cm52,cmx52

Note that cm52.obj is specified before cmx52.obj and cm52.lib is specified
before cmx52.lib.  This is the general rule:  ClipMore _before_ Comix.

Now let's create a 1000 record database and run the program a couple times:

    dbgen 1000
    test
    test
    test

You should see the 'J' records being displayed quickly in age order.  The
first run of TEST.EXE will take a little time as the indexes need to be
built.  The filter should always be very fast.


    <B>Next Step</B>

The best way to start using ClipMore is to find a small program that you
already have working with Comix and get it to work with ClipMore.

Usually there are a few key places where you are using filters (or an
equivalent) that are taking a long time.  Replace the SET FILTER TO commands
with a call to the cmFilter() function.  Alternatively,  #include "cm52.ch"
and SET FILTER TO will be mapped automatically to the cmFilter() function.

One important caveat is that you cannot reference local, static or array
variables in a condition.  However, this can be handled using the cm2Str()
function.  For example you can replace the code as follows:

    function myFun(cLast)

            //  Set up the filter
        set filter to field-&gt;last = cLast

            //  Do operations
        ...

            //  Clear the filter
        set filter to
    return nil

changes to:

    function myFun(cLast)

            //  Set up the filter
        cmFilter( "field-&gt;last = " + cm2Str(cLast) )

            //  Do operations
        ...

            //  Clear the filter
        cmFilter()
    return nil      

FOR conditions are not handled automatically (with the exception of the
INDEX and XINDEX commands).  To use the optimizer with FOR conditions, you
can replace the code as follows:

    copy to temp for &lt;cCond&gt;
    
changes to:

    cmFilter(&lt;cCond&gt;)
    copy to temp
    cmFilter()
