<B>rlSetFilter()</B>         Set the Filter RecordList
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlSetFilter(rl) -&gt; NIL

<B>Arguments</B>

    rl is the RecordList to be made the Filter RecordList.

<B>Returns</B>

    NIL.

<B>Description</B>

    rlSetFilter() allows you to control which records are made visible,
    similar to a SET FILTER TO.  When rlSetFilter(rl) is used, only records
    contained in rl will be retrieved.

    rlSetFilter() will automatically destroy any previously existing Filter
    RecordList.  It also transfers ownership of the RecordList to ClipMore.
    In other words, once you rlSetFilter() you should _not_ destroy it
    yourself.  ClipMore will automatically destroy it.

    rlSetFilter() is used by cmFilter() in order to optimize filters.
    cmFilter() uses rlNewQuery() to get a RecordList of records which meet
    the condition, and then use rlSetFilter() so that only records which
    meet the condition (i.e., are in the RecordList) are stopped at.

    The source code for cmFilter() &amp; cmReFilter() will give you good
    examples of how this function is used.

<B>Example</B>

    use demo

    *   Let the user tag Records
    rl := rlUserTag()

    *   Now make only these records visible
<B>    rlSetFilter(rl)</B>

    *   List out the last and first names for records the user has tagged
    list last, first

    *   NOTE: No need to destroy the RecordList because ClipMore will do
    *         so automatically (with rlSetFilter(), ownership of the
    *         RecordList has transferred to ClipMore)

    *   Should let user tag records, but just a dummy stub for simplicity
    function rlUserTag()
    local rl := rlNew()
    rlSet(rl, 50)
    rlSet(rl, 75)
    return rl
