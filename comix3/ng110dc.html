<B>Advance Overview</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter describes the advanced capabilities (RecordList functions)
provided by ClipMore.

These are intended to provide you with the ultimate in flexibility. However,
these functions _are_ complex and are _not_ necessary to use ClipMore.

We strongly recommend that you work with "cm" functions first, and then
progress to the "rl" functions when you require it.  You should skip this
chapter until you have worked with cm*() level functions.


<B>Low-Level Functions Background</B>

With ClipMore 1.0 and 1.1, we attempted to do everything for the developer.
ClipMore provided a simple interface (cmFilter()) and did many things very
well and easily.

However many developers want to do more.  It is impossible for us to
automatically meet all possible developer requirements.

To solve this problem, we have developed the "RecordList" interface.  Many
developers will not need to use this, but we have attempted to give you
complete flexibility to attack your application requirements in the best way
possible.

The RecordList interface is intended to provide you with the full "building
block" capabilities of the optimizer.  In other words, ClipMore now gives
you direct access to the low-level tools we have used to implement the
cmFilter() function itself.

We will continue to strive to make the optimizer more and more intelligent
in being able to automatically determine the best way to use your indexes.
In the meantime the RecordList interface provides you with complete
flexibility and control over the optimization process.


<B>Detail on ClipMore's Operation</B>

ClipMore works by analyzing your condition, matching up parts of your
condition with indexes, and scanning the indexes to determine which records
meet the condition.

For example, suppose you have the following condition: "age &lt;= 25 .and. salary
&gt;= 900000", and further assume that you have an index on age and salary.

ClipMore will analyze the condition and determine that you have an index an
index on age.  It will then scan the age index to determine all records
which have an age &lt;= 25.  This information (the records which meet this
condition) is stored in a RecordList.

It will then scan the salary index to determine all records which have a
salary &gt;= 900000, generating another RecordList.

These two RecordList's are then AND'd together to give you a single
RecordList of records which meet both conditions.

This resultant RecordList is then used to filter the records.  Records which
are not contained within the RecordList are never accessed.  Only records in
the RecordList are accessed.


<B>RecordList Interface</B>

Let's revisit the problem above using the RecordList interface.  We want all
records which meet the condition: "age &lt;= 25 .and. salary &gt;= 900000".

Using the RecordList interface, here's what it looks like:

    use demo
    set index to age, salary

    *   Get a RecordList which contains only the age &lt;= 25 records
    rlp1 := rlNew()
    rlSetLoHi(rlp1, nil, 25, "age")

    *   Get a RecordList which contains only the salary &gt;= 900000 records
    rlp2 := rlNew()
    rlSetLoHi(rlp2, 900000, nil, "salary")

    *   Get a RecordList which only has the records which meet both
    rlResult := rlAnd(rlp1, rlp2)

    *   Make this the filter (only records in this RecordList are considered)
    rlSetFilter(rlResult)

rlSetLoHi(), rlAnd(), and rlSetFilter() are the same tools used by ClipMore
itself to implement the cmFilter() function.  (We have provided the source
code to virtually of the cm*() functions).

This may seem like a lot more work than just using the cmFilter() function
(and it is).  However, it gives you unlimited flexibility.  If it's possible
to do it with a query optimizer (i.e., resolve a condition or determine a
value by using indexes), ClipMore now lets you do it.


<B>Filter RecordList</B>

There is one Filter RecordList per workarea.  The Filter RecordList controls
which records Clipper will actually access when moving through the database.

When a Filter RecordList has been set up, Clipper will only access records
which are contained in the Filter RecordList.  This is identical in effect
to a SET FILTER TO.

The difference is that when you do a SET FILTER TO, Clipper will actually
read the record to determine if the record meets the condition (and then go
on if it doesn't meet the condition).  When using a Filter RecordList,
ClipMore just checks to see if the record is in the RecordList _before_
accessing it.  If it isn't, then it goes onto the next record until it finds
a record which _is_ in the RecordList.

This process is very fast, since no time is spent retrieving non-matching
records.

rlSetFilter() allows you to make a RecordList be used as the Filter
RecordList for the workarea.


<B>Memory Allocation</B>

When you construct (create) a new RecordList, memory is allocated for the
RecordList.

A RecordList consists of a small amount of memory which is allocated to
store information about the RecordList.  This in turn has a pointer to a
Virtual Memory block which contains the bit-map.  The use of Virtual Memory
means that almost no real memory is used by a RecordList.

When you construct a RecordList (e.g., using rlNew()), a numeric value (a
long) is returned.  This long is a actually a pointer in memory to the
RecordList.

When you are done using a RecordList, you need to destroy (free) the
RecordList in order to free up the memory which has been allocated for it.

The one exception to this is discussed in the next section.


<B>Ownership</B>

When you create a RecordList, you own it and you are responsible for
destroying it to free the memory which has been allocated for the
RecordList.

However, when you use the rlSetFilter() function, you transfer ownership to
ClipMore.  At that point, ClipMore is responsible for destroying the
RecordList.  ClipMore will do this automatically when a new Filter
RecordList is set up (or the database is closed).
    
rlExFilter() (Extract Filter) reverses this process.  It allows you to get a
RecordList from ClipMore, so that you then own it.  When you have
rlExFilter()'d the filter RecordList, ownership of the RecordList transfers
to you, and you are then responsible for destroying it.


<B>Maybe's</B>

Maybe's are probably the hardest concept to understand in working with
RecordList's.

In a RecordList, a YES indicates that the record definitely meets the
condition.  A NO indicates that the record definitely does NOT meet the
condition.  This is relatively straightforward.

A MAYBE indicates that the record may meet the condition, or may not meet
the condition.

Suppose that you have the following condition:

    "age &lt; 25 .and. last = 'J'"

and that you have an index on "age", but no index on "last".

In this case, ClipMore will _not_ be able to determine which records meet
the "last = 'J'" part of the condition by using the indexes.  These will be
Maybe's.

This is what is meant by a condition being "Partially Optimizable."  We know
which records meet the "age &lt; 25" part of the condition, but we don't know
which records meet the "last = 'J'" part of the condition.  If we had an
index on "last", then the condition would be "Fully Optimizable" (i.e., we
could fully determine which records meet the condition solely by looking at
the indexes).

The only way to resolve Maybe's is to actually look at the records
themselves and determine whether or not they meet the condition.

Please note that in the example above we do know for _certain_ that many
records do not meet the condition (by using the age index).  Therefore, we
would only inspect records which are known to meet the "age &lt; 25" condition.
We would not have to check all records in the database.


<B>Optimization Techniques</B>

ClipMore employ several optimization techniques in order to give your
application the best possible performance in a variety of conditions.

<B>Index Optimization</B> is a technique whereby the index is scanned to
determine which records meet a condition (rather than looking at the records
themselves).  This is always the fastest technique, but does require that
appropriate indexes be available.

<B>Linear Optimization</B> is a technique for rapidly examining _all_ of the
Maybe records, and resolving them (i.e., making them either YES or NO's).

<B>Smart Filtering</B> is a technique where each of the Maybe records is
examined incrementally (as opposed to Linear Optimization which removes
_all_ of the Maybe's in a batch).  When a record is retrieved, ClipMore
determines if it meets the condition.  If it doesn't, the record is removed
from the Filter RecordList and never revisited.  This is called "Smart
Filtering", because ClipMore never retrieves a non-matching record twice.

Smart Filtering can make major improvements in the performance of filtered
TBrowse's even when no Index Optimization can be performed.
