<B>rlHasMaybe()</B>          Determine if the RecordList has any Maybe's
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<B>Synopsis</B>

    rlHasMaybe(rl) -&gt; lHasMaybe

<B>Arguments</B>

    rl is the RecordList for which the Maybe test is being performed.

<B>Returns</B>

    rlHasMaybe() returns .T. if rl has any Maybe's, .F. otherwise.

<B>Description</B>

    rlHasMaybe() returns whether or not the given RecordList has any
    Maybe's.

    The only place you can get Maybe's is from rlNewQuery() being passed a
    condition which is not fully optimizable.

<B>Example</B>

    *   Age is the only index
    use demo index age

    rl := rlNewQuery("age &lt; 25")
<B>    ? rlHasMaybe(rl)                    &amp;&amp; .F. (fully optimizable condition)</B>
    rlDestroy(rl)

    rl := rlNewQuery("age &lt; 25 .and. salary &lt;= 25000")
<B>    ? rlHasMaybe(rl)                    &amp;&amp; .T. (NOT fully optimizable because</B>
                                        &amp;&amp; we don't have an index no Salary)

    *   Set up a RecordList which has only the Maybe's
    *
    *   NOT Maybe is still Maybe so an rl AND'd with a NOT of itself will
    *   will have only Maybe's left
    *
    *   Truth Table:
    *
    *   rl      NOT rl      (rl) AND (NOT rl)
    *   --      ------      -----------------
    *   No      Yes         No
    *   Maybe   Maybe       Maybe &lt;-- only these remain
    *   Yes     No          No
    *
    rlMaybe := rlAnd(rlNewDup(rl), rlNot(rlNewDup(rl)))

    *   Say how many Maybe's there are
    ? "There are ", rlCount(rlMaybe), " maybe's"

    rlDestroy(rlMaybe)                  &amp;&amp;  Now clean up
    rlDestroy(rl)
