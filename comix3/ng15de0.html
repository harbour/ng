<B>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</B>

and below, promptly return the unopened disk package and all other items
(including written materials) for a full refund.

In consideration of the right to a refund of the license fee for any reason,
including any terms of this agreement which are unacceptable or are
unenforcable by reason of law or regulation applicable to you, within the 30
day period provided for your evaluation of the software and the terms, you
also expressly agree to waive all redress other than as provided by these

have a license.  The licensed developer is free to use it on as many
machines as is convenient (e.g., a home machine and office machine).  Using
the software is defined as linking with it, using the documentation or
compiling with the header files.

You will not create, or allow others to create, using any portion of the
Software, a general-purpose database program, or any product which is
intended to work with databases whose structure is not known at link time
(such as ease of use query interfaces, general purpose reporting programs,
etc.) or any product that is otherwise generally competitive with or a
substitute for the Software.

You may utilize the Software to prepare derivative works of application
programs which you own or control with no further license from or payment to
Loadstone, provided that the Software cannot be separated out, in whole or
in part, from any such derivative works.  You may modify the provided source
code for use in such derivative works.  You may NOT, however, distribute the
source code whether modified or not.

You may only transfer the software with the express written permission of
LoadStone.

You may NOT use, modify, copy or transfer the software package or any copy,
in whole or in part, except as expressly provided in this license.

Loadstone makes no warranty of any kind, either implied or expressed, for
the software and the software is provided solely on an "AS IS" basis. 
Loadstone expressly disclaims all implied warranties of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose.  In no event shall Loadstone be held
liable for any damages arising out of the use of the software.  In any
event, the liability of Loadstone or of any other party associated with the
transfer of license rights to you in connection with the software will not
exceed the fee paid for the software license.

<B>GENERAL:</B>

This software and associated written materials are copyrighted and include
methods and means covered by U.S. and foreign patents issued and pending. 
All rights are reserved.

This license agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Texas.

If any provisions of this agreement are for any reason declared to be
invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected
thereby.

national governments, agencies and/or instrumentalities, including the
United States Government, which may procure the Software, with RESTRICTED
RIGHTS, including all of the foregoing limitations and restrictions.
