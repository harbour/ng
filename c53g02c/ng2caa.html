 <B>C1005   Redefinition or duplicate definition of #define</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You have attempted to #define an identifier that is
     already defined.  This happens when you redefine an identifier without
     first undefining it with #undef.  This problem can occur because you
     simply omitted the #undef directive, it is an unintended side effect of
     including a header file that defined the same identifier, or
     architectural problems in the use of #define directives exist in the
     current program (.prg) file.

     <B>Action:</B>  Check first to see if you intended to redefine the
     specified identifier.  If you did, add a #undef directive above the
     #define directive.  If this is not the source of the problem, check to
     see if the identifier was first defined or redefined in any header file
     used by the current program (.prg) file.
