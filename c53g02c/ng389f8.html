 <B>37 Too many symbols in symbol table</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This error occurs with an application linked with
     Exospace.  The application will terminate immediately upon start up.
     This is caused by CODE GENERATORS that generate an excessive amount of
     symbols.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Decrease that amount and/or reuse symbols, declare as local.

     2. List .PRGs in .CLP files to compile fewer and larger .OBJ files.

     <B>See Also: </B> "Compiling" chapter in the Programming and Utilities
     Guide and the "CA-Clipper Technical Specifications" appendix.
