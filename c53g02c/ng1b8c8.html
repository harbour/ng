 <B>1109:   unable to open file &lt;filename&gt;</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that Blinker was unable to find
     the specified file in the current directory where it was expected to be,
     so the full directory path for the file should be specified.  If no file
     extension is specified for script files, Blinker assumes an extension of
     .LNK.  This error can also occur when Blinker is attempting to create a
     swap file and the TEMP environment variable points to an invalid
     directory.  When running on a network, it is also possible that another
     user deleted the file, or that you do not have network access rights to
     the file.

     <B>Action:</B>  If the file has been specified in the link script with a
     FILE command, check the OBJ environment variable; if it has been
     specified with a LIBRARY or SEARCH command, check the LIB environment
     variable.
