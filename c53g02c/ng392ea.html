 <B>332     String/array memory overflow</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The maximum capacity of the Segment Virtual Object
     Store (SVOS) system has been exceeded.  Due to the dynamic nature of
     SVOS, it is impossible to state exactly when this error will occur.  In
     the worst case, this error will occur when slightly over a megabyte of
     strings and/or arrays are in use; the best case is in excess of 16
     megabytes.  Probably the most common cause of this error is the
     declaration of extremely large arrays (e.g., LOCAL aArray[500][300]).
     every array element requires memory to store (even if its value is NIL).
     the number of array elements in an array is determined by multiplying
     the number of elements in every dimension and adding the sum of all
     dimensions except for the last.  For example, a 500 by 300 array has
     (500 x 300) + 500, or 150,500 elements.  As every array element in
     CA-Clipper requires 14 bytes, this amounts to 150,500 x 14 or 2,107,000
     byteswell in excess of one megabyte and, therefore, potentially
     dangerous.

     <B>Action:</B>  reduce the size and/or number of strings and arrays that
     are active at any one time.  Declare as many string variables and arrays
     LOCAL as possible.

     <B>Note: </B> There is no benefit gained by reusing arrays.  CA-Clipper is
     much more efficient when strings and arrays are thrown away and rebuilt
     often rather than kept around unnecessarily for long periods.
