 <B>1115:   &lt;file(module)&gt; : '&lt;symbol&gt;'unresolved external</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that the '&lt;symbol&gt;' defined as
     external in the file module cannot be found in any of the other .OBJ
     files or libraries in the script file.  The usual cause of this problem
     is that an object or library file required by the program has been
     omitted from the script file.  Another possible cause of this message is
     that some libraries require the use of the SEARCH command, as their
     library cross-reference records are not complete.

     <B>Action:</B>  Try a SEARCH on the library that you suspect contains the
     missing '&lt;symbol&gt;'.  If you are aware of the cause for this message and
     want to continue linking to create an executable file, use the command
     BLINKER EXECUTABLE NODELETE.

     <B>See Also:</B>  The Linker Reference Commands section in the "CA-Clipper
     Real Mode Linker--BLINKER.EXE" chapter of the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
