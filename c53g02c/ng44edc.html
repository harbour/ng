<PRE>
     The WORKING and BACKUP directories specified in the [AutoMake] section
     of CACI.INI (written to the Windows directory during installation) have
     not been properly defined.  They must exist and be distinct.  A file may
     have been deleted, renamed, moved or write-protected.  Less probable--
     but still possible--hard disk, directory structure, or file integrity
     may be compromised.
