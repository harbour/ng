 <B>415     Cannot open overlay file</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This error occurs when a CA-Clipper application cannot
     find or open an overlay file.  Overlay files include executable (.EXE)
     files (in the case of dynamic overlays), and static overlay (.ovl)
     files.  Probably the most common cause of this error is insufficient
     file handles available to the CA-Clipper application.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. The first step in trying to solve this problem is to increase the
        number of file handles available to the application.  refer to the
        Files and Buffers section in "The Runtime Environment" chapter of the
        Programming and Utilities guide.

     2. If an insufficient number of file handles is not the problem, it is
        possible that the CA-Clipper application cannot find the file it is
        trying to open.  It is possible that another file of the same name as
        the executable is in the DOS path and is being searched for the
        overlay.  Try renaming the executable.

     <B>See Also:</B>  Specifying the Location of Executable Files section in
     "The Runtime Environment" chapter of the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
