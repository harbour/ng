 <B>1204:   overlay file &lt;filename&gt; does not match the .EXE file</B>

     <B>Note:</B>  This error can occasionally result from the effects of a
     virus.  In this case, first try external overlays (via the SECTION INTO
     xxx command) marking the .EXE read-only, and then follow the procedures
     outlined below.  If nothing else helps, perform an extensive check for
     viruses and take the necessary measures for removal.

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that when the overlay manager
     opened the overlay file specified and created at link time, it was not a
     Blinker overlay file, or it was not prepared at the same time as the
     currently executing .EXE file.  This indicates that the correct copy of
     the overlay file has become overwritten by an older version, the newer
     version cannot be found in the current PATH, or the previous link was
     terminated before the overlay file was created correctly.
