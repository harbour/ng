 <B>1101    Maximum workareas exceeded</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  CA-Clipper supports 250 work areas.  This error can be
     produced if this limit is exceeded.  This usually indicates that an
     internal process tried to access a field which does not exist, or that
     an internal field structure is not valid for the work area.  This means
     the runtime system is out of work areas for work area index strings.

     <B>Action:</B>  A good place to start looking is in the third-party RDD or
     any "in house" C/ASM code.  Make sure the database driver was REQUESTed
     and linked.  Check the .LIBrary link order.
