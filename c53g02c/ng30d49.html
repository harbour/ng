 <B>DBFCDX/1054  The type or length of the key doesn't match what's stored</B>
 <B>             on disk</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  this error code indicates:

     1. a key expression has changed since the index was created.  For
        example, if you had an index on LAST and changed the width of the
        field from 20 bytes to 25 bytes, and then tried to use the old index,
        you would get this error.

     2. an index was created on an expression which has a variable length
        (e.g., TRIM(last)).  The key expression must always return a fixed
        length.

     <B>Action:</B>  Use PADR() to ensure that the key expression is always the
     same length.
