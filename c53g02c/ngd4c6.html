 <B>C3019   Too many publics</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This error can occur if you are using automatic
     compilation to compile too many program (.prg) files into a single
     object (.OBJ) file at one time.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Try breaking up the compile into two or more smaller groups of files.

     2. Change your overall program building strategy to use single-file
        compilation where a single program (.prg) file is compiled into a
        single object (.OBJ) file.  To compile using single-file compilation
        mode, use the /M option.
