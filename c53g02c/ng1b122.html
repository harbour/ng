 <B>1106:   not enough real memory to link</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that Blinker could not allocate
     enough real (DOS) memory to continue the link.  Blinker has a link-time
     virtual memory system that can use EMS (3.2 and higher), XMS (2.0 and
     higher) memory (or disk space) when conventional DOS memory is fully
     allocated.  However, Blinker still requires a certain amount of
     conventional DOS memory to complete the link cycle.

     <B>Action:</B>  To make more memory available, either remove one or more
     TSRs currently resident, run Blinker from outside a make utility, or
     reduce the number of buffers specified in the CONFIG.SYS.  Reducing the
     number of SECTION INTO and SEARCH commands will also reduce the memory
     needed at link time.

     <B>See also:</B>  The Linker Reference Commands section in the "CA-Clipper
     Real Mode Linker--BLINKER.EXE" chapter of the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
