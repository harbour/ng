 <B>C2014   LOOP statement violates enclosing SEQUENCE</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You specified a LOOP statement within BEGIN SEQUENCE
     and RECOVER statements without an enclosing DO WHILE or FOR loop.  This
     could happen for several reasons:

     1. You specified a LOOP statement with no enclosing DO WHILE or FOR
        control structure within a SEQUENCE.

     2. You are attempting to LOOP to a DO WHILE or FOR statement outside the
        current SEQUENCE from within the SEQUENCE.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Check first to see if you omitted the DO WHILE or FOR control
        structure statements.  If so, add the control structure statements.

     2. determine if you intended to LOOP to a control structure enclosing
        the current SEQUENCE.  If so, you must BREAK to the RECOVER or the
        END statements and then LOOP.
