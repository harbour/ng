 <B>C3032   Can't create intermediate file</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The compiler is attempting to create a temporary file
     to hold intermediate results and for some reason it cannot create the
     file.  This error can occur if you run out of directory entries or if
     you do not have create rights on a network drive.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Check with your network administrator to see if you have create
        rights in the directory in which you are compiling.

     2. Compile using the /T option to write temporary files to another drive
        or directory.

     3. Use DOS Set TMP= to a valid drive/directory.
