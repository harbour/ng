 <B>C3006   Can't create preprocessed output file </B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The compiler cannot create the preprocessed output
     file when the /P command-line option is specified.  This can happen for
     several reasons:

     1. You have run out of file handles.

     2. You have run out of disk space.

     3. You do not have create rights on a network.

     <B>Action:</B>  This error can be resolved in the following ways:

     1. Increase the number of file handles by changing the FILES statement
        in our CONFIG.SYS file.  Reboot and recompile.

     2. Delete unwanted files from disk and recompile.

     3. Ask your network administrator for create rights in the directory in
        which you are compiling.
