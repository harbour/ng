 <B>1116:   fixup overflow at &lt;offset&gt; in segment &lt;segment&gt; in &lt;module&gt;</B>
 <B>        referencing &lt;symbol&gt; in module &lt;module&gt;</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B> This message indicates the exact point in the code that
     refers to another symbol more than 64Kb away.  This may occur in one of
     a number of situations:

     1. Two related libraries may have been separated by other libraries in
        the link script file, so that the code in one library cannot reach
        the code in the other library.  This may also occur when related .OBJ
        files, possibly extracted from the same library, have been separated
        by too many other .OBJ files in the script file.

     2. Non-overlayable code may have been overlaid.  When third-party
        products are linked into the program, refer to the third-party
        documentation for their suggested method for dynamic overlaying.

     3. Two libraries may have declared the same segment names in different
        classes.  This should not occur in most programs.

     4. Two or more libraries may have been specified in an incorrect order
        within the link script.

     <B>Action:</B>  Determine which library is causing the problem by
     systematically removing each library and relinking.  When the offending
     library is found, contact Computer Associates technical support.  If the
     offending library is not found, modify the code so that &lt;symbol&gt; is
     accessed with a far reference, or ensure that the specified segment and
     symbol are accessible to one another by examining the MAP file for their
     respective locations.
