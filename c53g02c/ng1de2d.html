 <B>1122:   &lt;file(module)&gt; : compiled with Summer '87 not 5.x</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that Blinker has determined
     that the specified module was compiled with CA-Clipper Summer '87, but
     that the first FILE in the application was compiled with CA-Clipper 5.3.
     All CA-Clipper compiled modules in a single application must be compiled
     with the same version of CA-Clipper.

     <B>Action:</B>  Ensure you are linking the correct versions of the CA
     libraries and any third-party libraries for the version of CA-Clipper
     that you are using, and also make sure all CA-Clipper compiled .OBJ
     files were compiled with the same version of CA-Clipper.
