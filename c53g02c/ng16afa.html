 <B>4047:  Current and previous file versions inconsistent  (Serious)</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  After a file has been read into memory, its handle may
     be reused if necessary.  If the file is needed again, it is assigned
     another handle and read again.  If the file has changed in the meantime,
     you see this message.  It is most likely to occur if the file is on a
     network.
