 <B>C2086   RETURN violates enclosing SEQUENCE</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You specified a RETURN statement between a BEGIN
     SEQUENCE statement and the corresponding RECOVER statement (or END
     statement, if no RECOVER statement is used).

     The only valid ways to exit from a SEQUENCE are to BREAK or to execute
     across the end of the code in the SEQUENCE.

     <B>Action:</B>  Reorganize your code so that the RETURN occurs in the
     RECOVER code or outside the SEQUENCE, and recompile.

     <B>Note:</B>  This error is a deviation from previous releases of
     CA-Clipper in which it was allowed.
