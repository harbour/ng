 <B>DBG0100 Unable to connect to Windows/DOS communications Pipe.</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  CA-Clipper Workbench could not establish contact with
     the CA-Clipper program.

     <B>Action:</B>  Place the following line in the [386Enh] section of the
     SYSTEM.INI file: Device = CAWDCI.386

     The file CAWDCI.386 has been installed to the Windows system directory
     upon installation of the CA-Clipper Workbench.  Be sure that this file
     exists in this directory.  Be sure that an environment variable named
     PIPEHANDLE exists. If it does not, add the following line to the
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     SET PIPEHANDLE=0
