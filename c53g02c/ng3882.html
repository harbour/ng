 <B>C2005   Statement not recognized</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The current statement cannot be recognized by the
     compiler.  This happens when a command is not recognized by the
     preprocessor and is passed to the compiler without translation.

     This error commonly happens when you fail to specify a required comma
     separator for certain statement options, such as items in a list.  Some
     examples are the REPLACE command, which requires multiple WITH clauses
     separated by commas, and the COPY TO command, which requires fields
     specified as a comma-separated list.

     <B>Action:</B>  Correct the statement containing the erroneous command and
     recompile.  If you are defining your own command, check the command
     definition to determine why the specified command is not translated.
