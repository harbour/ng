     This chapter is a summary of VMM error messages and DOS/16M error
     messages for the protected mode linker.  The messages are divided into
     categories on the basis of the point in the program at which they occur
     and the circumstances in which they occur.

 <B>VMM Error Messages</B>

     This section lists VMM error messages that can occur in the main program
     or when starting and running a VMM-managed program.

     <B>Loader Errors</B>

     VMM displays a loader error message only if the error occurs in your
     main program, not in a spawned program.  When a loader error occurs
     while you are spawning a program, an error code is returned to the main
     program during the spawn.  Error messages returned during the spawn
     process are displayed with only the last three digits of the error
     number.  The loader error messages are listed below.  Each message is
     preceded by the words "VM error<B> </B>[number]:" and the error code. The
     mnemonic appears in parentheses at the end of each error code
     description.

     <B>Startup and Runtime Messages</B>

     This section lists the messages you may receive when starting and
     running a VMM-managed program.  For each message there is a brief
     explanation.  Each error message is preceded by a "VM error [number]:"
     and the error code.  Some of these messages indicate problems in VMM; in
     which case, call Computer Associates Technical Support.

 <B>DOS/16M Error Messages</B>

     This chapter lists DOS/16M error messages, with descriptions of the
     circumstances in which the error is most likely to occur, and
     suggestions for remedying the problem.  The chapter covers the
     following:

     <B>Kernel error messages (single- or double-digit error numbers)</B>

     This section describes error messages from the DOS/16M kernel.  Kernel
     error messages may occur as the result of a problem in either the
     DOS/16M kernel or the application program.  If the message originates in
     the kernel, it will be tagged as a DOS/16M error.  If the error occurred
     in the application program, DOS/16M will use the name of the program
     file in the header.  Messages that have a space immediately after the
     open quote occur only at load time.  After your program is loaded, these
     messages are discarded to save memory.  When a percent symbol (%)
     appears in the error message text, the string it represents is in
     parentheses after the error message text.

     <B>CA-Clipper/Exospace messages (four-digit numbers)</B>

     This section lists and describes CA-Clipper/Exospace messages.  The
     first section lists error messages in numeric order.  The error level is
     enclosed in parentheses after the error text.
