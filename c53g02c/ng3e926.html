 <B>4424    Temp file creation error</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  An error occurred when creating a temporary file for
     indexing or sorting.  This error can occur for several reasons:
     insufficient file handles, an invalid TEMPPATH or insufficient network
     rights for the directory where temporary files are created.  Note that
     temporary files are created in the current directory if no TEMPPATH is
     specified.

     <B>Action:</B>  Correct the environment.  If insufficient network rights
     are the problem, either give the user the necessary rights, or redirect
     the temporary file to a more appropriate directory.  Check file
     ownership and network rights.

     <B>See Also:</B>  "The Runtime Environment" chapter of the Programming and
     Utilities Guide.
