 <B>C3007   Can't open #include file</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The preprocessor cannot open the file specified in a
     #include directive.  The file is either misspelled or not located in any
     of the directories specified by the INCLUDE environment variable.

     <B>Action:</B>  Correct the problem by changing the filename including its
     directory in your DOS INCLUDE environment variable, or by using the /I
     option to temporarily add one or more directories to the front of the
     INCLUDE directory list.
