 <B>1131 :  error closing file &lt;filename&gt;</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  It is likely that the file specified has been
     inadvertently deleted by another user on the system while Blinker was
     still using it, or there could be a network or disk failure.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make sure the file actually exists and that you have
     sufficient rights on the network.  if you are not on a network, make
     sure your disk is free of errors.
