 <B>999     Attempt to execute invalid code</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  CA-Clipper has attempted to execute something that it
     does not recognize as valid CA-Clipper code.  This error can occur if an
     attempt is made to execute code compiled with a new version of
     CA-Clipper under an older version, or because of a corrupted or invalid
     executable.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make sure that all code is compiled under the same version
     of CA-Clipper and is being linked with the correct version of the
     libraries.  If a third-party linker is used, see if the error occurs
     when using CA-Clipper/Exospace or Blinker.  If a corrupted executable is
     suspected, recompile all .OBJ files and relink.
