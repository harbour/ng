 <B>DBFNTX/1010  Read error</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  A read error occurred on the specified file.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. If the file is on a floppy disk, make sure the disk is properly
        seated in the drive.  In a network environment, make sure the network
        connection is still valid; check for problems at the server.

     2. Check to make sure that the index, memo file, and.dbf file have not
        been truncated by DOS's CHKDSK or a similar utility, and that there
        is no file corruption.

        This can also occur if the STACK space is not enough.

     Utilities Guide
