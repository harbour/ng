 <B>DBFNTX/1011  Write error</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  A write error occurred on the specified file.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Check to make sure that sufficient disk space and directory entries
        are available.  Make sure the file is not marked read-only.

     2. In a network environment, make sure the application has the necessary
        rights to write to the file.

     3. On Novell networks, make sure that the FILE OWNER has not been
        deleted from the user list.  Make the file owner SUPERVISOR.

     4. Check to see if the media has failed, or if a physical lock has been
        placed on the file region in question.
