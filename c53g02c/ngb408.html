 <B>C2079   Circular #translate/#command</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You specified a #translate/#xtranslate or
     #command/#xcommand directive in terms of itself.  A circular #translate
     or #command cannot be resolved by the preprocessor and is, therefore,
     not allowed.

     When using #command and #translate, keep in mind that both directives
     match four-character abbreviations for keywords.  This may cause an
     unexpected match which could lead to this error.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Check to see if the problem is related to the four-letter rule using
        either #translate or #command.  If it is, change the directive to
        either #xtranslate or #xcommand as both require an exact match.

     2. Remove the circular definition and recompile.
