 <B>Extended Memory Not Available</B>

     CA-Clipper/Exospace uses extended memory, not expanded memory.  If you
     can configure your memory either way and you are not running under an
     expanded memory manager, be sure to configure the memory as extended
     memory.

     If you are using an expanded memory manager that follows the VCPI
     protocol (such as EMM386, QEMM, or 386MAX), your CA-Clipper/Exospace
     application allocates its memory from the VCPI host (unless you also
     have an XMS manager).  Therefore, you do not have to configure it as
     extended memory.

     If you have a VCPI host and an XMS manager (such as HIMEM.SYS),
     CA-Clipper/Exospace allocates memory from both the VCPI pool and the XMS
     pool.

     If you have another program that uses extended memory, see the
     Troubleshooting section in the "CA-Clipper Protected Mode Linker--
     EXOSPACE.EXE" chapter of the Programming and Utilities Guide.
