 <B>670     Memory initialization error</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  An error has occurred during the initialization or
     re-initialization of the memory system.  This error usually indicates an
     extremely low memory condition at startup, or that an application that
     was RUN from within CA-Clipper allocated DOS memory without freeing it.

     <B>Action:</B>  If the error occurred at startup, more conventional memory
     should be made available for the application.  If it occurred
     immediately following the RUN command, the application that was run
     should be eliminated to see if this solves the problem.  This problem
     may also occur with an improperly linked or corrupted application.
