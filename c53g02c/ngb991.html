 <B>C3001   Out of memory</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The compiler has run out of memory.

     <B>Action:</B>  The easiest solution is to make the program smaller by
     reducing the number of procedures or functions defined in the program
     (.prg) file or reducing the number of program files in the compiler
     script file.  Reducing the number of preprocessor directives used in the
     application may also help. If possible, you could make more memory
     available to the compiler by temporarily unloading any memory-resident
     programs currently in memory.
