     This section is a summary of error messages possible when compiling a
     program (.prg) file with CLIPPER.EXE.  The messages are divided into
     categories according to severity and the point where the error occurs in
     the compilation process.  Each category is described below, followed by
     a listing of all messages organized by category.

     The listed compiler error and warning messages are a subset of all the
     possible messages the compiler can display, and they represent the most
     likely problems that will be encountered during compilation.

 <B>Compiler Warning Messages</B>

     Compiler warning messages indicate potential program errors that are not
     fatal to the compilation process.  After a warning, compilation
     continues with no affect on the generation of the output object (.OBJ)
     file.  The DOS return code is not set when a compiler warning is
     generated.

     The general format of a compiler warning message is as follows:

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;(&lt;line&gt;):  Error C1xxx &lt;message text&gt;[: &lt;symbol&gt;]</B>

 <B>Compiler Error Messages</B>

     Compiler error messages identify program errors that may be fatal to the
     compilation process.  After a compilation error, the compiler attempts
     to recover and continue.  In most cases, however, recovery will not be
     possible and compilation terminates with no object (.OBJ) file
     generated.  The DOS return code is set to 1 when a compiler error is
     generated.

     The general format of a compiler error message is as follows:

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;(&lt;line&gt;):  Error C2xxx &lt;message text&gt;[: &lt;symbol&gt;]</B>

 <B>Compiler Fatal Error Messages</B>

     Compiler fatal error messages indicate a very serious problem has
     occurred during the compilation of a program (.prg) file.  Because of
     the severity, compilation terminates immediately and no object file is
     generated.  The DOS return code is set to 1 when a fatal compiler error
     is generated.

     The general format of a fatal error message is as follows:

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;(&lt;line&gt;):  Error C3xxx &lt;message text&gt;[: &lt;symbol&gt;]</B>
