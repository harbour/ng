 <B>1118:   too many external overlays</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that more than 15 unique
     external overlay file names were specified in the link script file.
     This version of Blinker only supports up to 15 external overlays.  It
     should be noted that with Blinker's dynamic overlaying, the only reason
     to have more than one external overlay file is so that each overlay file
     will fit onto a 360KB disk, if required for distribution purposes.

     <B>Action:</B>  Reduce the number of external overlay file names in the
     link script file.

     <B>See also:</B>  The Linker Reference Commands section in the "CA-Clipper
     Real Mode Linker--BLINKER.EXE" chapter of the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
