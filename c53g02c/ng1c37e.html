 <B>1113:   segment &lt;name&gt; or its group exceeds 64kb</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates one of a number of situations:

     1. Two related libraries may have been separated by other libraries in
        the link script file, so that the code in one library cannot reach
        the code in the other library.  This may also occur when related .OBJ
        files, possibly extracted from the same library, have been separated
        by too many other .OBJ files in the script file.

     2. Non-overlayable code may have been overlaid.  When third-party
        products are linked into the program, refer to the third-party
        documentation for their suggested method for dynamic overlaying.

     3. Two libraries may have declared the same segment names in different
        classes.  This should not occur in most programs.

     4. Two or more libraries may have been specified in an incorrect order
        within the link script.

     5. The program's default data segment (usually named DGROUP in the
        program's MAP file) may have exceeded 64K in size.

        <B>Action for Situation 5:</B>  If the default data segment exceeded 64K
        when using CA-Clipper, determine which third-party product is using
        the most of DGROUP by systematically removing each library and
        running the program with the //INFO parameter of the CLIPPER
        environment variable enabled.  When the offending library is found,
        contact Computer Associates technical support.

     <B>Note: </B> For CA-Clipper applications, the usual cause of this problem
     is that the first .OBJ file specified on the command line or in the
     script file is not a CA-Clipper .OBJ file.  When linking a CA-Clipper
     application the first .OBJ file specified must be the CA-Clipper
     starting program.

     If these approaches do not work, and recreating or reinstalling the
     specified file does not help, then contact Computer Associates technical
     support.
