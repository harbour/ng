 <B>1214:   error accessing EMS overlay cache</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that an error has occurred
     while the Blinker overlay manager is accessing EMS for the storage
     and/or retrieval of overlays in the overlay cache.

     <B>Action:</B>  Disable the BLINKER CACHE EMS command in the link script
     file.  If this fixes the problem, it is possible that you have a TSR or
     device driver working in the background which is manipulating EMS
     directly in a non-standard manner.  Try removing all TSRs and device
     drivers from the system except for the EMS driver, and test if the
     problem still occurs.  If it does, contact Computer Associates technical
     support.

     <B>See also:</B>  The Linker Reference Commands section in the "CA-Clipper
     Real Mode Linker--BLINKER.EXE" chapter of the Programming and Utilities
     Guide.
