     The following sections contain a complete list of the Blinker error
     messages with a description of each error and reasons for their
     occurrence.  The errors are divided into the following classes:

     <B>.</B> 10xx - Link-time warning messages

     <B>.</B> 11xx - Link-time fatal messages

     <B>.</B> 12xx - DOS real mode runtime messages

     Link-time warning messages are only for information.  They do not set
     the DOS ERRORLEVEL.  As a result the execution of Blinker and any MAKE
     utilities being used will continue unaffected.  These warning messages
     may be disabled altogether using the BLINKER MESSAGE NOWARNING command.

     Link-time fatal messages and runtime messages, on the other hand, are of
     a more serious nature.  They cause immediate termination of program
     execution, and set the DOS ERRORLEVEL to 1.
