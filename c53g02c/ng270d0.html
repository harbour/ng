 <B>BASE/1005    No exported variable</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  You attempted to assign an exported instance variable
     using the send operator (:), but the left operand was not an object,. or
     the object has no exported variable with the specified name.

     <B>Action:</B>  Some suggestions to resolve the problem are:

     1. Check to make sure that the value being operated on is of the proper
        type or class.

     2. Make sure the name of the instance variable is spelled properly.
