 <B>C3003   Can't open intermediate file</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The compiler created a temporary file to contain
     intermediate results and could not open the file at a later time.  This
     error is extremely unlikely to occur.

     <B>Action:</B>  If the TMP environment variable is set to a network drive,
     make sure that the drive mapping is still valid.  Ensure that there is a
     sufficient number of file handles.
