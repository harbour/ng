 <B>TERM/2015    Open error (TO FILE clause)</B>

     <B>Default Behavior:</B>  The program will continue without opening the
     file specified in the TO FILE clause, and the command will operate as if
     the TO FILE clause had not been specified.

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The file referred to in a TO FILE clause of the REPORT
     FORM, LABEL FORM or other command could not be created or opened for
     writing.

     <B>Action:</B>  Check to make sure that sufficient disk space and directory
     entries are available.  If the file exists, make sure it is not marked
     read-only.  In a network environment, make sure the application has the
     necessary rights to create or modify the file.

     <B>See Also:</B>  REPORT FORM command, LABEL FORM command
