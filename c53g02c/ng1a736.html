 <B>1017:   Blinker for CA-Clipper 5.3 does not support the command '...'</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This message indicates that the link script file
     command has been ignored as it refers to a feature which is only
     available in the full product version of Blinker, not in Blinker for
     CA-Clipper 5.3.

     <B>See also:</B>  Refer to file BLINKER.TXT in the directory in which CA-
     Clipper is installed for details on upgrading to the full version of
     Blinker.
