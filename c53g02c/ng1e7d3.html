 <B>1128:   &lt;file(module)&gt; : unrecognized .OBJ record type nnh</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  Blinker encountered an object record type which is not
     currently supported.  It is possible that the module in question is
     corrupted.  If recreating or reinstalling the module does not solve the
     problem, contact Computer Associates technical support.  Also, Blinker
     may have encountered a new type of object record; perhaps one which has
     been created by a new compiler version which is not supported by the
     version of Blinker being used.

     <B>Action:</B>  Refer to the file BLINKER.TXT in directory in which CA-
     Clipper is installed for details on upgrading to the full version of
     Blinker.
