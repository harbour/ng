 <B>17:  "System software is neither VCPI nor DPMI"</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  Some memory resident program has put your 386 or 486
     CPU into Virtual 8086 mode.  This is done to provide special memory
     services to DOS programs, such as EMS simulation (EMS interface without
     EMS hardware) or high memory.  In this mode, it is not possible to
     switch into protected mode unless the resident software follows a
     standard that DOS/16M supports. VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface)
     is one such standard and is followed by QEMM from Quarterdeck, 386MAX
     from Qualitas, and EMM386 from Microsoft, among others. DPMI (DOS
     Protected Mode Interface) is another standard that DOS/16M supports.
