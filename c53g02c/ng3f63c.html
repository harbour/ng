 <B>5306    Conventional memory exhausted</B>

     <B>Explanation:</B>  This is an "out of memory" message that indicates that
     the CA-Clipper application no longer has sufficient conventional memory
     available to continue.

     Specifically, this error occurs when the virtual memory system attempts
     and fails to bring a VM segment memory into conventional memory that has
     been swapped out to disk or expanded memory.

     <B>Action:</B>  Make more conventional memory available to the VM system.
     This can be done in several ways:

     1. Increase the amount of conventional memory available before running
        the application (by removing TSRs, making use of a 386 memory
        manager, etc.).

     2. Dynamically overlay C and ASM code.

     3. Ensure that any C or assembly language code in use is making use of
        the virtual memory system if it is doing dynamic memory allocation.
        Any memory allocated using the Fixed Memory Allocator functions
        (_xalloc() and _xgrab()) reduces the amount of conventional memory
        available if it is not immediately freed.

     Technical Reference Guide.
