 <B>TERM/2014    Create error (SET PRINTER command)</B>

     <B>Default Behavior:</B>  The program will continue without opening the
     file or device specified in the SET PRINTER command.  If there was a
     file or device open from a previous SET PRINTER command, it will be
     closed.

     <B>Explanation:</B>  The file or device referred to in a SET PRINTER
     command could not be created or opened for writing.

     <B>Action:</B>  If opening a file, check to make sure that sufficient disk
     space and directory entries are available.  If the file exists, make
     sure it is not marked read-only.  In a network environment, make sure
     the application has the necessary rights to create or modify the file.
     If printing to a network device or queue, make sure that the designated
     device exists and is accessible to the workstation.

     the Programming and Utilities Guide
