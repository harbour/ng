 <B>CA-Clipper Real Mode Linker--BLINKER.EXE</B>
 Features high-speed linking, dynamic overlaying, caching of overlay,
 compression of the symbol table, and "burning" the CLIPPER environment
 variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Blinker Commands</B>

     Script file(s) are specified on the command line and default to an
     extension of .LNK.  They may be nested, and more than one may be used on
     the command line, for example:

     <B>BLINKER @Defaults @Other LIB Mylib VERBOSE</B>

     This command line instructs Blinker to read the script file DEFAULTS.LNK
     followed by the script file OTHER.LNK.  It also instructs Blinker to use
     the library MYLIB.LIB and to display a VERBOSE listing of the .OBJ files
     being processed.  The full names of the commands, or any unique
     abbreviation of the words which comprise the commands, may be used
     although it is recommended that at least three letters be used for
     clarity.  For example, the command BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE 40 can be
     abbreviated to BLI OVE OPS 40.

     Most Blinker commands may be specified in any order, at any point in the
     link script file.  Typically the first FILE statement should specify the
     .OBJ containing the main program procedure.

     <B># ...</B>

     Indicates text as a script file comment.  Any line in the script file
     beginning with the character # is treated as a comment and is ignored by
     Blinker.  If the # ... character occurs within a line, the rest of the
     line is ignored.

     <B>// ...</B>

     Indicates text as a script file comment.  Any line in the script file
     containing the characters // is treated as a comment and is ignored by
     Blinker.  If the // ... characters occur within a line, the rest of the
     line is ignored.

     <B>@&lt;scriptname&gt;</B>

     Specify the name of a script file.  Blinker supports nested script files
     of any size to a depth of 5 levels.  The processing of nested script
     files is similar to a program function call.

     <B>BEGINAREA</B>

     Specifies the start of a dynamic overlay area to the linker.  Each
     BEGINAREA should have a corresponding ENDAREA to indicate the end of the
     overlay area.

     <B>BLINKER CACHE EMS &lt;nuMax[%]&gt;</B>
     <B>   [, &lt;nuMinLeave[%]&gt;]</B>

     Specifies the amount of EMS (LIM version 4.0 and higher) memory to be
     used for the overlay cache.  Two numeric parameters are used to specify
     the amount of EMS memory to be allocated and the amount to be left for
     program use.  Both parameters may be specified as either a number of KB,
     or as a percentage of the total available EMS.

     <B>BLINKER CACHE XMS &lt;nuMax[%]&gt;</B>
     <B>   [, &lt;nuMinLeave[%]&gt;]</B>

     Specifies the amount of XMS (version 2.0 and higher) memory to be used
     for the overlay cache.  Two numeric parameters are used to specify the
     amount of XMS memory to be allocated and the amount to be left for
     program use.  Both parameters may be specified as either a number of KB,
     or as a percentage of the total available XMS.

     <B>BLINKER CLIPPER PAGE ON | OFF</B>

     Enables/Disables automatic CA-Clipper 5.3 code paging.

     <B>BLINKER ENVIRONMENT CLIPPER &lt;cName&gt;</B>

     Changes the name of the CA-Clipper environment variable from the default
     setting of "CLIPPER" to any string of up to 16 characters, and thus
     avoids the remote site settings for the CLIPPER environment variable.

     <B>BLINKER ENVIRONMENT NAME &lt;cName&gt;</B>

     Specifies the name of the environment variable for Blinker runtime
     options.  By default, if the argument is not specified, the default
     setting is BLINKER.

     <B>BLINKER ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDE</B>

     Commands Blinker to allow the CA-Clipper environment variables set using
     the BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command to be overridden at application
     run time by the settings of the CLIPPER environment variable.  When
     doing this, you may want to consider renaming your CLIPPER environment
     variable with the command BLINKER ENVIRONMENT CLIPPER.

     <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE CLIPPER &lt;cEnvironmentstring&gt;</B>

     Burns default values for the CA-Clipper runtime environment variables
     into the executable file.  Those settings set using the BLINKER
     EXECUTABLE CLIPPER command take precedence over those set with the SET
     CLIPPER command.

     <B>BLINKER EXECUTABLE NODELETE</B>

     Creates .EXE regardless of unresolved externals, although the resulting
     .EXE is not guaranteed to operate correctly.

     <B>BLINKER LINK EMS ON | OFF</B>

     Controls whether or not EMS memory is used at link time by the virtual
     memory system within Blinker.

     <B>BLINKER LINK PAGEFRAME ON | OFF</B>

     Controls the use of the EMS pageframe by Blinker at link time by the
     virtual memory system within Blinker.

     <B>BLINKER LINK XMS ON | OFF</B>

     Controls whether or not XMS memory is used at link time by the virtual
     memory system within Blinker.

     <B>BLINKER MESSAGE DUPLICATES</B>

     Causes Blinker to generate the 1004 link-time warning message for all
     duplicate symbols within libraries encountered at link time.

     <B>BLINKER MESSAGE NOBLINK</B>

     Disables the blinking eyes which are displayed while Blinker is running.

     <B>BLINKER MESSAGE NOWARNING</B>

     Suppresses the display of Blinker link-time warning messages 1001 to
     1100.

     <B>BLINKER MESSAGE WINK [LEFT]</B>

     Enables single eye winking during linking.  If no parameter is entered,
     the right eye will wink (from Blinker.s point of view, i.e., from inside
     the screen looking out).  The parameter LEFT causes the left eye to
     wink.

     <B>BLINKER OVERLAY OPSIZE &lt;nuSize&gt;</B>

     Requests a size for the overlay pool at run time in KB.  It can be set
     to any value between 12KB and 128KB.  The default operating size is
     40KB.

     <B>BLINKER OVERLAY PAGEFRAME ON | OFF</B>

     Allows the overlay manager to utilize the expanded memory pageframe for
     the overlay pool (maximum size 64Kb), on machines equipped with LIM EMS
     (3.2 or higher) expanded memory boards or emulators.

     <B>BLINKER OVERLAY THRESHOLD &lt;nuLimit&gt;</B>

     Sets the threshold size below which code specified to be overlaid will
     be moved back to the root section of the program.

     <B>BLINKER OVERLAY UMB ON | OFF</B>

     Used in conjunction with a suitable XMS driver it allows the Blinker
     overlay manager to execute overlays in upper memory blocks above 640KB.

     <B>BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH &lt;nuDepth&gt;</B>

     Specifies maximum depth of CA-Clipper procedure nesting.  This depth is
     the number of procedure calls that are executed before a procedure
     return.

     <B>DEFINE &lt;symbol&gt;[, &lt;symbol&gt; ...]</B>

     Specifies symbols to be excluded at link time and points them to a dummy
     routine in the overlay manager.

     <B>DEFLIB</B>

     Uses default library search records to locate and link libraries which
     are specified within an object module.

     <B>ECHO [ON | OFF |] [&lt;cString&gt;]</B>

     ECHO ON &lt;cString&gt; turns on echoing of the script file to the screen,
     with the first line displayed being &lt;cString&gt; if it is specified.  ECHO
     OFF turns off echoing to the screen of the script file and ignores the
     rest of the line.

     <B>ENDAREA</B>

     Specifies the end of an overlay area to the linker, as described in the
     BEGINAREA section.

     <B>EXTDICTIONARY</B>

     Specifies that Blinker should use the extended dictionary that is
     appended to library files by some librarian utility programs.

     <B>FILE [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt;</B>
     <B>   [, [d:][path]&lt;filename&gt; ...]</B>

     Specifies to the linker the names of one or more .OBJ files to be
     included in the output file at that point.

     <B>LIBRARY [d:][path]&lt;libname&gt;</B>
     <B>   [, [d:][path]&lt;libname&gt; ...]</B>

     Specifies one or more program libraries required by the program.

     <B>MAP [=[d:][path]&lt;filename&gt;] [S][,A]</B>

     Requests a segment map of the executable.

     <B>MIXCASE</B>

     Causes Blinker to treat all publics and externals as case sensitive at
     link time, rather than converting them to UPPERCASE.

     <B>MODULE &lt;module&gt; [,&lt;module&gt; ...]</B>
     <B>   [FROM &lt;libname&gt;]</B>

     Specifies placement of individual library modules regardless of whether
     the originating libraries or object modules are specified within an
     overlay area or not.

     <B>MURPHY</B>

     Causes the overlay manager to attempt to force any inadvertent overlay
     errors (programming errors) to manifest themselves during testing or
     debugging.

     <B>NOBELL</B>

     Suppresses the beep upon completion of link.

     <B>NODEFLIB</B>
