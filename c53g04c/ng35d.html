 <B>CA-Clipper Compiler--CLIPPER.EXE</B>
 Compiles one or more program files (.prg) containing procedures and user-
 defined functions to form an object file (.OBJ).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>CLIPPER [&lt;sourceFile&gt; | @&lt;scriptFile&gt; [&lt;option list&gt;]]</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;sourceFile&gt;</B> is the name of the program file to compile to an object
     file.  If no extension is specified, (.prg) is assumed.  The filename
     can optionally include a drive designator and a path reference.

     <B>&lt;scriptFile&gt;</B> is the name of an ASCII text file containing a list of
     source files to compile into a single object file.  The default
     extension for this file is (.clp).

     <B>&lt;option list&gt;</B> is a list of one or more options to control the course
     of the compilation, all of which are described below.  To get a list of
     options, specify the compiler command line with no arguments.

 <B>Compiler Options</B>

     All options are shown in uppercase preceded by a slash (/).  Note,
     however, that options are not case-sensitive and that you can replace
     the slash with a dash (-) if you prefer.

     Some compiler options have arguments.  If an option has arguments,
     specify them after the option, with no space between the option and
     its first argument.

     <B>/A</B>

     Declares any variable included in a PRIVATE, PUBLIC, or PARAMETERS
     statement as MEMVAR.

     <B>/B</B>

     Includes debugging information in the object file.

     <B>/D&lt;identifier&gt;[=&lt;text&gt;]</B>

     Defines an identifier to the preprocessor with &lt;text&gt; assigned to the
     &lt;identifier&gt; if specified.

     <B>/ES[&lt;severityLevel&gt;]</B>

     Specifies the severity level of warnings.

     If &lt;severityLevel&gt; is 0 or omitted, the compiler does not set the DOS
     ERRORLEVEL upon exit if warnings are encountered.  This is the default
     behavior of the compiler.

     If &lt;severityLevel&gt; is 1, the compiler sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon exit
     if warnings are encountered but still generates an .OBJ file.

     If &lt;severityLevel&gt; is 2, the compiler sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon exit
     if warnings are encountered and does not generate an .OBJ file.  This
     effectively promotes warnings to error status.

     <B>/I&lt;pathName&gt;</B>

     Adds the specified directory to the front of the INCLUDE path list.
     Multiple /I options can be specified in the same compiler session to
     specify several header file search directories.

     <B>/L</B>

     Excludes the program source code line numbers from the object file.

     <B>/M</B>

     Compiles only the current program file (.prg) suppressing automatic
     search for program files (.prg) referenced in a program file with the
     DO, SET FORMAT, and SET PROCEDURE commands.

     <B>/N</B>

     Suppresses the automatic definition of a procedure with the same name as
     the program file (.prg).

     <B>/O&lt;objFile&gt;</B>

     Defines the name and/or location of the output object file.

     <B>/P</B>

     Preprocesses the program file (.prg) and copying the result to an output
     file with a (.ppo) extension.

     <B>/Q</B>

     Prevents line numbers from displaying while compiling.

     <B>/R[&lt;libFile&gt;]</B>

     Embeds a library search request in the object file.  If /R is specified
     without &lt;libFile&gt; name, the default requests for CLIPPER.LIB,
     EXTEND.LIB, DBFNTX.LIB, and TERMINAL.LIB are suppressed.  Multiple /R
     options can be specified in the same compiler session to embed more
     than one library request.

     <B>/S</B>

     Checks the syntax of the current (.prg) file and no object file is
     generated.

     <B>/T&lt;pathName&gt;</B>

     Specifies a different directory for temporary files generated during
     compilation.

     <B>/U[&lt;userStandardHeaderFile&gt;]</B>

     Identifies an alternate standard header file to preprocess in place of
     the supplied STD.CH which is used automatically.

     <B>/V</B>

     Forces the compiler to assume all references to undeclared or unaliased
     variable names are public or private variables.

     <B>/W</B>

     Generates warning messages for undeclared or unaliased (ambiguous)
     variable references.

     <B>/Z</B>

     Suppresses shortcutting optimizations on the logical operators .AND. and
     .OR.  This option is provided as an aid to isolating code that depends
     on the behavior of older versions of CA-Clipper.
