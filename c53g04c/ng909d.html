 <B>Database Utility--DBU.EXE</B>
 Creates and modifies database structures; performs simple data management
 tasks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     <B>DBU [/&lt;colorString&gt;] [&lt;filename&gt;] /E</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;colorString&gt;</B> is /C for color and /M for monochrome.

     <B>&lt;filename&gt;</B> is the name of a view file (.vew) previously created in
     DBU or a database file (.dbf).  Specifying this argument causes DBU to
     open and browse the specified file.  Otherwise, the main screen is
     active where you can open files and access the DBU menu bar.

     <B>/E</B> opens the file EXCLUSIVE.  This parameter is not case-sensitive.

 <B>System Architecture</B>

     DBU is provided in source code form.  If you installed CA-Clipper in the
     default configuration, the following source files are located in the
     \CLIP53\SOURCE\DBU directory:

     <B>.</B>  Dbu.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbu.hlp
     <B>.</B>  Dbucopy.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuedit.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuhelp.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuindx.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbunet.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbustru.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuutil.prg
     <B>.</B>  Dbuview.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit your
     specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to your
     development environment or simply add the DBU system to your
     application, thereby giving your users the power to create and modify
     their own database file structures.

     To facilitate maintenance of the DBU program files, the make file,
     DBU.RMK, is also installed with the DBU source files.  Assuming your
     current DOS directory is \CLIP53\SOURCE\DBU, you can easily rebuild
     DBU.EXE after you make source code changes with the following command:

     RMAKE DBU

     If your changes involve additional source modules or changes in the
     existing file dependencies, you will need to update DBU.RMK to reflect
     those changes.
