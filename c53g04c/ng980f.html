 <B>Report and Label Utility--RL.EXE</B>
 Creates and modifies report (.frm) and label (.lbl) files.

     <B>RL</B>

 <B>System Architecture</B>

     RL is provided in source code form.  If you installed CA-Clipper in the
     default Configuration, the following source files are located in the
     \CLIP53\SOURCE\RL directory:

     <B>.</B>  Rlfront.prg
     <B>.</B>  Rllack.prg
     <B>.</B>  Rldialg.prg

     The system is provided as source code so you can modify it to suit your
     specific needs.  You may want to make enhancements specific to your
     development environment or simply add the RL system to your application,
     thereby giving your users the power to create their own reports and
     labels.

     The RL system is broken up into two primary subsystems: front and back.
     The RL front subsystem (found in Rlfront.prg) is the user interface of
     the entire RL system.  The back subsystem (found in Rlback.prg) contains
     all of the routines for reading and writing (.frm) and (.lbl) files.
     The system is organized in this way so that you can create your own user
     interface and easily access the lower-level routines to read and write
     the form files.

     To facilitate maintenance of the RL program files, the make file,
     RL.RMK, is also installed with the RL source files.  Assuming your
     current DOS directory is \CLIP53\SOURCE\RL, you can easily rebuild
     RL.EXE after you make source code changes with the following command:

     RMAKE RL

     If your changes involve additional source modules or changes in the
     existing file dependencies, you will need to update RL.RMK to reflect
     those changes.
