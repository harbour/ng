 <B>childSync()</B>
 Post a pending relational movement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>ERRCODE childSync(</B>
     <B>                     AREAP wa,</B>
     <B>                     LPDBRELINFO lpdbRelInfo</B>
     <B>                    )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>lpdbRelInfo</B> is a pointer to a structure containing information on a
     relation.

 <B>Description</B>

     childSync() posts lpdbRelInfo as a pending relational movement indicating
     that the child work area referenced by wa has been affected by a
     parental movement.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  Note that grandchildren must have relative movements posted in
        them after the child moves.  This means that any implementation of
        this method should make a call to syncChildren() after doing its
        business.

     <B>.</B>  childSync() does not physically move the child's cursor.
        childSync() should simply post notification that a relational
        movement is pending.  It can later be resolved (if necessary) by
        forceRel().
