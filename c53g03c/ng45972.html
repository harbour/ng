 <B>Elements</B>

     <B>itmCobFor / lpstrFor</B>

        Contain a code block and a character expression, respectively,
        representing the conditional FOR clause.  FOR expressions are,
        essentially, filters that hide rows (records) which evaluate
        to FALSE.  The character value is provided for storage, while the
        code block is provided as a parameter for the evalBlock() method.

     <B>itmCobWhile / lpstrWhile</B>

        Contain a code block and a character expression, respectively,
        representing the conditional WHILE clause.  WHILE clauses permit
        continuation of a process that steps through rows until its
        expression evaluates to FALSE.  The character value is provided for
        storage, while the code block is provided as a parameter for the
        evalBlock() method.

     <B>lNext</B>

        Contains a numeric value representing the CA-Clipper-level NEXT lNext
        scoping clause.  This permits continuation of a process for the NEXT
        lNext rows, while obeying FOR and WHILE clauses.

     <B>itmRecID</B>

        Contains a numeric value representing the CA-Clipper-level RECORD
        itmRecID scoping clause.  This permits continuation of a process for
        a single record, while obeying FOR and WHILE clauses.

     <B>fRest</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level boolean value that is set to TRUE if a
        process should continue stepping through data from the current
        work area cursor position until logical end of file.

     <B>fIgnoreFilter</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level boolean value that is set to TRUE if a
        process should ignore any filter condition imposed on the current
        work area.

     <B>fIncludeDeleted</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level boolean value that is set to TRUE if a
        process should include deleted rows.

     <B>fLast</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level boolean value that is set to TRUE if the
        last record of the current scope is required.

     <B>fIgnoreDuplicates</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level boolean value that is set to TRUE if a
        process should ignore duplicate key values.

     <B>Warning!</B>  You should perform code block evaluations with great
     caution.  Save any states that are likely to change as a result of
     re-entrance, so you can restore them after the code evaluation.
