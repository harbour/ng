 <B>Elements</B>

     <B>lprfsHost</B>

        Contains a pointer to the virtual method table for this work area (see
        RDDFUNCS).

     <B>uiArea</B>

        Contains a numeric value representing the number assigned to this
        work area.  This number is analogous to the value returned by the
        CA-Clipper SELECT() function.

     <B>atomAlias</B>

        Contains a character data type value representing the CA-Clipper
        ALIAS of the work area.

     <B>uiFieldExtent</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the total number of columns
        allocated for the work area.  Columns are allocated by a call to
        setFieldExtent().

     <B>uiFieldCount</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the total number of columns
        currently in use by the work area.  uifieldCount is incremented with
        each call to addField().

     <B>lpFields</B>

        Contains a pointer to an array of FIELD items.  lpFields defines all
        the fields used by this work area including type, length, and name
        (see FIELD).

     <B>lpFieldExtents</B>

        Contains a pointer to an array of additional field properties.

     <B>valResult</B>

        Contains an item that is used on occasion by the CA-Clipper runtime
        system and may be used by the RDD developer as an all purpose result
        holder for an operation.

     <B>fTop</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if the record pointer is
        on the first logical record.

     <B>fBottom</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if the record pointer is
        on the last logical record.

     <B>fBof</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if logical beginning of
        file is reached.

     <B>fEof</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE if logical end of file
        is reached.

     <B>fFound</B>

        Contains a boolean value that is set to TRUE when a seek() operation
        successfully locates a key value.

     <B>dbsi</B>

        Contains a data structure specifying the scoping condition used by
        the CA-Clipper LOCATE command (see DBSCOPEINFO).

     <B>dbfi</B>

        Contains a data structure specifying the filter condition to use for
        the work area (see DBFILTERINFO).

     <B>lpdbOrdCondInfo</B>

        Contains a pointer to a data structure specifying the order condition
        to use for the work area (see DBORDERCONDINFO).

     <B>lpdbRelations</B>

        Contains information about relations currently in use by the work area
        (see DBRELINFO).

     <B>uiParents</B>

        Contains a numeric value specifying the number of parent work areas
        currently in effect for this work area.

     <B>heap</B>

        Contains a virtual memory handle that can be used by the RDD
        developer to allocate a VM heap and make use of the VM heap
        suballocation routines available through the Virtual Memory API.

     <B>heapSize</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the size of the heap, above.

     <B>rddID</B>

        Reserved.

     <B>Note:</B>  In addition to being used by the data structures indicated
     in the Used By section below, the AREA structure is used by all methods
     in the RDD API.

 <B>Files</B>  Header file is Rdd.api.
