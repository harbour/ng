 <B>goToId()</B>
 Position the cursor to a specific, physical identity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>ERRCODE goToId(</B>
     <B>                     AREAP wa,</B>
     <B>                     ITEM itmRecID</B>
     <B>                  )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>itmRecID</B> is the physical identity of the row.  This may be a row
     number or some other unique identifier.

 <B>Description</B>

     goTold() repositions the work area cursor for wa to the physical row identifier
     itmRecID.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  This method is used to implement the DBGOTO() function.  It is
        designed so that the driver can identify rows using a means other
        than the physical row number.

     <B>.</B>  Since goToId() repositions the cursor to a physical row
        number, you need not consider active scopes, filters, or orders.  If
        lRec is not in the range of available rows, you can generate an error
        or position the cursor to the physical end-of-file.

     <B>.</B>  In CA-Clipper, the idea of a phantom row is vital to the
        performance of certain functions.  The goToId() method should permit
        access to the phantom row.  The phantom row is defined as the last
        row + 1 and is the position at which end-of-file is set to TRUE.  All
        columns of the phantom row are empty.  An lRec value greater than the
        last row in the table should position the cursor to the phantom row.
        If you do not support the concept of the phantom row in your driver,
        you must document this fact as an incompatibility between your driver
        and the high-level CA-Clipper functionality.
