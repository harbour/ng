     <B>ERRCODE goHot(</B>
     <B>                  AREAP wa</B>
     <B>               )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

 <B>Description</B>

     goHot() informs the RDD that data in memory is not guaranteed to match
     data in the data store (usually a disk).

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     You must implement the default behavior of this method through a
     subclass.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The concept of hot and cold refers to the current state of
        information in memory as it relates to information on disk.  If the
        information in memory, has changed since last written to disk, it is
        considered hot.  A cold work area's memory is in sync with its disk-
        based counterpart.

     <B>.</B>  When a work area goes hot in a shared environment, you must be
        certain that all necessary locks are in place.  Going hot indicates
        that a write is about to be performed on data.

     <B>.</B>  You must never allow work areas marked as wa-&gt;fReadonly to call
        goHot().  This is an ideal place to generate runtime recoverable
        errors indicating that locks must be present or the work area must not
        be in a read-only mode.

     <B>.</B>  wa should remain hot until it is marked cold by goCold().
