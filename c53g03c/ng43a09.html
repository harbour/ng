 <B>Elements</B>

     <B>fActive</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether one or more valid
        conditions have been specified in the structure.

     <B>abFor / itmCobFor</B>

        Contain a CA-Clipper-level reference to a string and a matching code
        block containing the key expression defining the FOR condition to be
        used for the creation and maintenance of the order.

     <B>itmCobWhile</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level reference to a code block defining the
        WHILE condition to be used for the creation of the order.  If NIL, no
        WHILE condition is being specified.

     <B>itmCobEval</B>

        Contains a CA-Clipper-level reference to a code block defining the
        expression to be evaluated every lStep rows (records) during the
        creation of the order.  The code block referenced should always
        evaluate to either TRUE (indicating that creation of the order should
        continue normally) or FALSE (indicating that order creation should
        terminate).  A return value of FALSE from itmCobEval does not
        constitute an error condition but rather is the mechanism by which an
        RDD is informed that no more rows are to be included in the order.

     <B>lStep</B>

        Contains a numeric value determining the frequency of the evaluation
        of itmCobEval.

     <B>lStartRecno</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the row at which to begin
        processing when either the lNextCount or fRest scoping options are
        specified.

     <B>lNextCount</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating the number of rows to process for
        order creation.

     <B>lRecno</B>

        Contains a numeric value indicating a single row to include in the
        order.

     <B>fRest</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating that only the rows specified by
        lStartRecno through end of file (EOF) are to be included in the
        order.

     <B>fDescending</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the order should be
        created in descending order.

     <B>fScoped</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the order is to be
        scoped.  fScoped will be TRUE if any of itmCobWhile, lNextCount,
        lRecno, fRest, or fAll are specified.

     <B>fAll</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether all rows are to be
        processed during order creation.

     <B>fAdditive</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether open orders should remain
        open while the new order is being created.

     <B>fUseCurrent</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether only rows in the
        controlling order will be included in this order.

     <B>fCustom</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the new order will be a
        custom-built order.

     <B>fNoOptimize</B>

        Contains a boolean value indicating whether the FOR condition will be
        optimized.

     <B>lpvCargo</B>

        Contains a pointer to a value of any data type provided as a user-
        definable slot.  It may be used by the RDD developer as an all-
        purpose holder.
