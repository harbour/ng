 Report end of relation

 <B>Prototype</B>

     <B>                     AREAP wa,</B>
     <B>                     LPDBRELINFO lpdbRelInfo</B>
     <B>                  )</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>wa</B> is a pointer to self.

     <B>lpdbRelInfo</B> is a pointer to a structure containing information on a
     relation.

 <B>Description</B>

     childEnd() indicates that one of wa's parent work areas is no longer related.

 <B>Default Behavior</B>

     childEnd() indicates that the referenced work area is related to one less
     parent by decrementing wa-&gt;uiParents.  This method does not physically
     unhook a child from a parent.

     <B>Warning!</B>  There is no check to guarantee that <B>wa-&gt;uiParents</B> will
     wrap from 0 to 255 after the decrement.

 <B>Implementation Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  If your RDD supports relations, ensure that the child work area
        (denoted by wa) does not have a pending relational move that relies
        upon the existence of the parent referenced by lpdbRelInfo.  If such
        a movement exists, it must be resolved by a call to SELF_FORCEREL()
        prior to removal.

     <B>.</B>  In most driver implementations, parent-child relations will be
        stored exclusively in the parent work area.  clearRel() removes all
        child relations from a parent; there is no way to remove a single
        relation from a parent's relation list using the CA-Clipper DML.
