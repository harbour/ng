 <B>Introduction</B>

     The functions in this chapter provide system information about the
     operating system (MS-DOS), the BIOS, and hardware.  It determines a
     large number of system facts and settings -- from the DOS-COUNTRY
     setting to the mathematical coprocessor.  It is even possible to warm or
     cold boot a computer from within a program.  In addition, you can query
     and set  DOS VERIFY and BREAK.
