 <B>ATADJUST()</B>
 Adjusts the beginning position of a sequence within a string
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>ATADJUST(&lt;cSearchFor&gt;,&lt;cString&gt;,&lt;nEndpoint&gt;,</B>
     <B>   [&lt;nCounter&gt;],[&lt;nIgnore&gt;],[&lt;nCharacter|</B>
     <B>   &lt;cCharacter&gt;]) --&gt; cString</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cSearchFor&gt;</B>  Designates the character string for which the function
     searches, or the character string that provides the reference point for
     adjustment.

     <B>&lt;cString&gt;</B>  Designates the character string within which the
     adjustment occurs.

     <B>&lt;nTargetPosition&gt;</B>  Designates from which position within the
     character string the search expression is adjusted.

     <B>&lt;nCounter&gt;</B>  Designates which occurrence of the &lt;Searchexpression&gt; is
     taken into account.  The default value is for the last occurrence.

     <B>&lt;nIgnore&gt;</B>  Designates the number of characters at the beginning of
     the search string that are removed.  The default value is none.

     <B>&lt;nCharacter|cCharacter&gt;</B>  Designates a character, as necessary, to
     carry out the adjustment.  It can be an individual character or an ASCII
     value between 0 and 255.  The default value is a space CHR(32).

 <B>Returns</B>

     ATADJUST() returns the modified character string.

 <B>Description</B>

     The function first looks for the &lt;cSearchFor&gt; parameter within the
     character string.  From this point, the rest of the &lt;cString&gt; is moved
     (adjusted) by either inserting or removing blanks until the
     &lt;nTargetPosition&gt; is reached.  In lieu of blanks, &lt;nCharacter&gt;|
     &lt;cCharacter&gt; can be used as a fill character.

     Additionally you can specify that the nth occurrence of &lt;cSearchFor&gt; be
     used and whether or not a specific number of characters at the beginning
     of the search string is eliminated.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Using CSETATMUPA() can influence how the search is performed.
        Using SETATLIKE() permits the use of wild cards within the search
        sequence.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Align comments at column 60.  The search is for the first
        occurrence of "//".  Since there is usually at least one space before
        each "//", search for " //":

        ? ATADJUST(" //", Line, 60, 1)

     <B>.</B>  Move the extensions for the following list of file names to
        position 10 and eliminate the ".":

        WINDOW.DBF
        PLZ.DBF
        BACK.DBF
        HELP.DBF
        LOG.DBF

        CHARREM(".", ATADJUST(".", File, 10))

        WINDOW      DBF

        PLZ         DBF
        BACK        DBF
        HELP        DBF
        LOG         DBF

     <B>.</B>  Use ATADJUST() with CSETATMUPA().  There is always a problem
        determining whether "AA" occurs twice or three times in "AAA".
        Depending on CSETATMUPA(), the function searches behind the last
        character, or starts from the last character of a located sequence:

        CSETATMUPA(.F.)
        ? ATADJUST("AA", "123AAABBB", 7, 2)       // Sequence not found

        CSETATMUPA(.T.)
        ? ATADJUST("AA", "123AAABBB", 7, 2)       // "123A  AABBB"
