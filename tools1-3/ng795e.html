 <B>WCLOSE()</B>
 Closes the active window
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>WCLOSE() --&gt; nWindow</B>

 <B>Returns</B>

     WCLOSE() returns the window handle that will subsequently become active.

 <B>Description</B>

     This function closes the currently selected window.  Control is returned
     automatically to the window with the highest handle or number.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The window handle closed with WCLOSE() is subsequently
        available again and can be reused with the next WOPEN()

     <B>.</B>  If the physical screen (Window 0) was active prior to the
        window closure with WCLOSE(), then Window 0 is skipped over and the
        window that was active before the WCLOSE() is selected.

 <B>Example</B>

     After this command sequence you are in window 3, not window 2:

     WSELECT(3)
     WSELECT(2)
     WSELECT(5)
     WCLOSE()
