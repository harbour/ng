 <B>SETPBIOS()</B>
 Redirects print output to the BIOS or DOS, and establishes the timeout
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SETPBIOS(&lt;nPrinter&gt;,[&lt;nRefreshRate&gt;]) --&gt; lBIOSPrint</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nPrinter&gt;</B>  Designates whether the printer output is through DOS (0)
     or BIOS on printer 1, 2, or 3.

     <B>&lt;nRepeatRate&gt;</B>  Designates how frequently an output attempt is made
     from extended drivers if the printer is not ready.  The default value is
     1000 attempts.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The function returns .T. when the selected output setting is
     successfully established.

 <B>Description</B>

     The default setting for CA-Clipper's printer output is through DOS.
     SETPBIOS() configures the extended driver in such a way that all
     subsequent printer output is directed through the BIOS.  This
     configuration gives you certain advantages.  You can determine the
     timeout for printers that are not ready.  Using &lt;nRepeatRate&gt;, you
     determine how frequently the output should be attempted before the
     program falls into an error trap.  Printer output on local printers is
     usually quicker, at least as long as the printer is able to accept the
     files quickly enough (hardware spoiler, built in printer buffer memory).

     For BIOS output, you must always designate the selected printer with the
     &lt;nPrinter&gt; parameter.  This setting then has absolute priority over any
     previously setting using the CA-Clipper SET PRINTER TO command.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  If you use the SET PRINTER TO command, the extended drivers
        ignore the SETPBIOS() setting.

     <B>.</B>  The extended driver can test to see if the printer is busy or
        not, before the output of a single character, but only when the
        extended driver outputs with BIOS.  In this case, the extended driver
        waits until the printer can once again receive files.

     <B>.</B>  BIOS output functions in all systems that have an interrupt
        17h that is compatible with the IBM BIOS.

     <B>.</B>  BIOS output successfully operates in those networks that
        reroute the corresponding interrupt 17h.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Specify printer output through BIOS to LPT2, independently of
        the CA-Clipper SET PRINTER TO setting:

        SET PRINTER TO LPT1
        ? SETPBIOS(2)                  // .T. if OK

     <B>.</B>  This is the same setting with a shortened timeout:

        SETPBIOS(2, 100)               // 100 repetitions

     <B>.</B>  Reset the print output to DOS:

        ? SETPBIOS(0)                  // .F. when via DOS
