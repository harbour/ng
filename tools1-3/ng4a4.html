------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CA-Clipper Tools contains over 800 functions which you can use to
     develop CA-Clipper applications and system-level routines.  These
     functions give CA-Clipper programmers capabilities previously reserved
     for C or Assembler programmers with detailed system knowledge.

     In order to use working memory as economically as possible, virtually
     all the functions are written in Assembler and are highly optimized.
     This guarantees high speed with a minimal use of memory.  This
     efficiency is further supported by the modularity of the software within
     the CA-Clipper Tools library.
