 <B>WORDONE()</B>
 Reduces the multiple appearances of particular double characters to one
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>WORDONE([&lt;cDoubleCharacter&gt;],&lt;cString&gt;) --&gt; cString</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cDoubleCharacter&gt;</B>  Designates which 2-byte sequences are only to
     appear once together in &lt;cString&gt;.  The default value is for all 2-byte
     sequences.

     <B>&lt;cString&gt;</B>  Designates a string that has only specific 2-byte
     sequences that appear together after manipulation.

 <B>Returns</B>

     WORDONE() returns the modified character string.

 <B>Description</B>

     A unique operation is carried out on a string that is constructed out of
     2-byte sequences ("words").  The multiple sequence appearances must lie
     immediately beside one another, which allows a CHARSORT() with an
     element length of 2 to be executed.

     These sequences can be integers that have been generated using the
     CA-Clipper I2BIN() function and have been deposited in a string.  In
     conjunction with other string functions like WORDONLY(), WORDONE() is an
     extremely effective system for working with these kinds of files.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  The term "word" is not used here in the textual sense, but
        rather as it is used in assembler programming.  A "word" consists of
        units of 16 bits, or more precisely, 2 bytes.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  This is a simple example with characters that can be
        displayed.  The "AB" lie one after the other but not the "12":

        ? WORDONE("12ABAB12")             // "12AB12"

     <B>.</B>  The function always runs through the string in ordered pairs:

        ? WORDONE("12", "1212ABAB")       // "12ABAB"
