 <B>Number and Bit Manipulation</B>

     This module discusses  number and bit manipulation.  Specifically, the
     numeric section deals with conversions between two different number
     systems, and the creation of random numbers.

     The bit manipulation section covers such required binary operations as
     AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, and how to test, set and clear bits.  The
     NUMLOW() and NUMHIGH() functions are important for CA-Clipper Tools
     functions that take two 8-bit values and return them as combined 16-bit
     numbers.  An example is the GETCURSOR() function from the Extended
     Drivers module.

     Many of the functions in this module have a &lt;value&gt; parameter type.  In
     this case, a number can be in the range of 0 to 65535 (or 4 294 967 295)
     and/or a hexadecimal string in the range of "0000" to "FFFF" (or
     "FFFFFFFF").
