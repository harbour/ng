 <B>DISKREADYW()</B>
 Queries whether you can write to a drive
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>DISKREADYW([&lt;cDriveId&gt;]), [&lt;lDOS/BIOS&gt;]) --&gt; lDiskReady</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cDriveId&gt; </B> Designates which drive designator (A, B, C, etc.) to
     query.  The default value is the current disk drive.

     <B>&lt;lDOS/BIOS&gt;</B>  This logical parameter allows you to specify whether
     you want to query the function through the BIOS (.F.) or DOS (.T.).  The
     default is described in the Description below.

 <B>Returns</B>

     DISKREADYW() returns .T. when you query a drive that is operational and
     can be written to.

 <B>Description</B>

     As with DISKREADY(), this function determines if a drive is ready to
     use.  DISKREADYW() also determines if you can write to a drive.
     DISKREADY() cannot tell if a disk has a write-protect marker on it.  In
     this case, drive A: might be ready, but you could not write to it.  Use
     this function to build write-protect detection for important disks into
     the program.

 <B>Network Drives </B>

     In general, drives mapped within networks are viewed by the function as
     accessible and return .T. as a result.  For a disk, "accessible" means
     you can create, open, and delete files.  You can clearly differentiate
     these rights within networks such as Novell NETWARE.  Therefore, you
     must test for these accordingly.

 <B>DOS or BIOS </B>

     In the simplest case, this function always tests the respective drive
     through DOS.  If drive B: is unavailable, the message  "Please insert
     disk in drive B:" is output from the operating system.  When you test
     floppy drives drive A: and B:, the BIOS route is recommended, since no
     message is output.  In any event, A: and/or B: can be mapped drives
     within a network.  Use the following logical expression to cover all the
     previous situations:

     (NETDISK(&lt;cDrive&gt;) .OR. &lt;cDrive&gt; &gt;= "C")

     This logical expression returns .T. when the respective drive is either
     on the network or has a drive identifier of C: or higher.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Research indicates work in the OS/2 compatibility box must be
        in the BIOS mode.

 <B>Example</B>

     Determine if you can write a file to A: drive:

     IF DISKREADY("A")
        IF NETDISK ("A")
           IF NNETRIGHTS ("A:\")      // complete path
           * ...
           ENDIF
        ELSE
           IF DISKREADYW("A")
           ? "Disk is not write protected!"
           ELSE
           ? "Disk is write protected!"
           ENDIF
        ENDIF
     ELSE
        ? "Disk drive not ready!"
     ENDIF
