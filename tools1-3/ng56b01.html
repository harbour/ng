 <B>RANGEREM()</B>
 Deletes characters that are within a specified ASCII code range
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>RANGEREM(&lt;cCharacter1&gt;,&lt;cCharacter2&gt;,&lt;cString&gt;)</B>
     <B>   --&gt; cResultString</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cCharacter1&gt;</B> and <B>&lt;cCharacter2&gt;</B>  Designate the first and the
     last character of the character range.

     <B>&lt;cString&gt;</B>  Designates the character string that is edited.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The function returns the modified character string.

 <B>Description</B>

     RANGEREM() allows you to delete all characters that are in a particular
     ASCII range.  For example, you could delete all control characters in a
     character string.

     The designated range can run "back to front", meaning &lt;cCharacter2&gt; can
     have a lower value than &lt;cCharacter1&gt;.  In such a case the range extends
     from the larger value to 255 and also from 0 to the smaller value.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Since the length of the character string is changed, passing
        by reference will not work here as it does with RANGEREPL().

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Delete all control characters:

        cString   :=  RANGEREM(0, 31, cString)

     <B>.</B>  Delete all characters that are not upper case, alpha
        characters:

        cString   :=  RANGEREM(91, 64, cString)
