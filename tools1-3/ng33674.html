 <B>COM_READ()</B>
 Reads characters from the receiving buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>COM_READ(&lt;nComPort&gt;,[&lt;nLength&gt;],[&lt;lNoDelete&gt;])</B>
     <B>   --&gt; cCharacterstring</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nComPort&gt;</B>  Designates the port (1 to 4) that is read.

     <B>&lt;nLength&gt;</B>  Designates the number of the characters in the buffer
     that are read.  The default value reads all characters.

     <B>&lt;lNoDelete&gt; </B> Designates whether or not characters are removed from
     the buffer as they are read.  The default setting removes all characters
     from the buffer as they are read.  However, if the parameter is .T., the
     characters remain in the buffer as long as it is not full.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The returned string contains the corresponding characters from the
     receiving buffer.

 <B>Description</B>

     All characters arriving at the serial port are stored in the appropriate
     buffer under interrupt control.  It is possible to determine the number
     of characters in the buffer and to read one, several, or all of the
     characters.  If the &lt;nLength&gt; parameter is not specified, then all the
     characters in the buffer are read.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Remember that you can receive additional characters between
        calling COM_COUNT() and COM_READ().

 <B>Example</B>

     Wait until at least 10 characters have been received:

     DO WHILE COM_COUNT(1) &lt; 10             // Wait until 10
                                            // characters in buffer
        *...
     ENDDO

     cInput := COM_READ(1, 10)              // Read in 10 characters
     ? cInput                               // Display characters
                                            // that are read
