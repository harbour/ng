 <B>SHOWKEY()</B>
 Continuously displays the INSERT and LOCK status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SHOWKEY([&lt;cKey&gt;, [[&lt;nLine&gt;], [&lt;nColumn&gt;], &lt;cTextON&gt;,</B>
     <B>   &lt;cTextOFF&gt;, [&lt;cAttrON|nAttrON&gt;],</B>
     <B>   [&lt;cAttrOFF|nAttrOFF&gt;]]]) --&gt; cNull</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cKey&gt;</B>  Designates which key to monitor in the form of a letter
     ("C", "N", "S", or "I").  If &lt;cKey&gt; is the only parameter in SHOWKEY()
      (C, N, S, or I), the respective key monitoring is uninstalled.

     <B>&lt;Line&gt; </B> Designates the line where the display occurs.

     <B>&lt;nColumn&gt;</B>  Designates the column where the display occurs.

     <B>&lt;cTextON&gt;</B>  Designates text for the active status.  A maximum length
     of 15 characters is allowed.

     <B>&lt;cTextOFF&gt;</B>  Designates text for the inactive status. There is a
     maximum of 15 characters and it must have the same length as &lt;cTextON&gt;.

     <B>&lt;cAttrON|nAttrON&gt;</B>  Designates the color attribute for the active
     status.  The default value is 7/0.

     <B>&lt;cAttrOFF|nAttrOFF&gt; </B> Designates the color attribute for the inactive
     status.  The default value is the same as in &lt;cAttrON|nAttrON&gt;.

     ()  If you call SHOWKEY() without parameters, it uninstalls.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The SHOWKEY() function always returns a null string.

 <B>Description</B>

     SHOWKEY() is an extremely versatile system that can be used to monitor
     the NUM-LOCK, SCROLL-LOCK, CAPS-LOCK, and INSERT keys.  After it is
     installed, you can display an indicator for each key, the desired screen
     position, and a color attribute (without concerning the CA-Clipper
     program).  You can establish a display for both the active and inactive
     status with individual color attributes.  However, both these strings
     must have the same length.

     Since the system INSERT status is handled separately from the
     CA-Clipper INSERT status, this monitoring can only be implemented from
     within a READ.  An indicator display, in so far as it has been
     activated, is refreshed in intervals of approximately 200 milliseconds.
     Therefore, when you clear a portion or the complete screen, do not
     concern yourself with restoring this display.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>Warning!</B>  Always uninstall this function before you leave a program
     or use the Extended Drivers provided with this CA-Clipper Tools.  The
     function changes interrupt vectors.  You may cause a system crash, if
     the old status is not restored before you exit the program!  Use the
     enclosed INTSAVE program to avoid this problem.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  Display "CAPS" if CAPS-LOCK is on: CAPS-LOCK for off: "    ",
        in line 24, column 50.  The default value for on and off is "7/0"

        SHOWKEY("C", 24, 50, "CAPS", "    ")

     <B>.</B>  Attributes can be numeric and or designated as in CA-Clipper:

        SHOWKEY("N", 24, 60, "NUM ON", "NUMOFF", 112, "W/R")

     <B>.</B>  Inverse the display for on and off:

        SHOWKEY("S", 24, 70, "SCRL", "  ", "0/7")

     <B>.</B>  Uninstall the NUM-LOCK display:

        SHOWKEY("N")

     <B>.</B>  Uninstall the function:

        SHOWKEY()
