 <B>Introduction</B>

     This chapter discusses printer output.  Although CA-Clipper handles
     printer errors with an error trap, it is always better to avoid them
     completely.  As a result, error traps for printer output will not become
     superfluous, since errors also occur during output.  You can also
     determine a wide variety of information, such as the number of available
     printers or the printer status.

     This chapter also describes functions that support DOS print spoolers.
     To implement these functions, prior to starting the respective
     application, you must run the DOS PRINT program to make the print
     spooler memory resident.  Files can then be exclusively passed from a
     program to the spooler.  However, you must first reroute your print
     output to a file (SET PRINTER TO &lt;file&gt;), before you can output it in
     the background.
