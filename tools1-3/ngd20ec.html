 <B>Introduction</B>

     CA-Clipper enables you to program nested  GET/READ masks.  The functions
     in this chapter are retained in CA-Clipper Tools for compatibility
     reasons and to make them easy to use.

     The active GET is saved with the help of a character string and restored
     through this string later.  This allows you to newly query inputs
     without losing your main input mask.  You can save KEYTRAP() definitions
     the same way and redefine them as you wish.

     <B>Important!</B>  It is impossible to use the saved information any longer
     that the runtime of an application.  The character string that results
     cannot be saved to a file and reloaded later.

     Other functions in this chapter return information about GET fields,
     such as screen position, the names of the accompanying variables, or
     information about whether a field is currently active.
