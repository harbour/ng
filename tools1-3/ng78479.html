 <B>FONTROTATE()</B>
 Rotates and mirrors images within a font string
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>FONTROTATE(&lt;cFontstring&gt;,&lt;nTurnDirection&gt;</B>
     <B>   [&lt;nPixelHeight&gt;],[&lt;nStart&gt;]) --&gt; cNewFontString</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cFontstring&gt;</B>[@]  Designates the font in character string form,
     within which the characters are rotated or mirrored.

     <B>&lt;nTurnDirection&gt;</B>  Designates the rotation axis or rotation direction
     in numeric form with a value from 1 to 3 (see Description).

     <B>&lt;nPixelHeight&gt;</B>  Designates the accompanying pixel height and number
     of bytes that represent an individual character within a font string.
     This is only necessary for modes 1 and 3.

     <B>&lt;nStart&gt;</B>  (This is for only for mode 1.)  Designates from which
     pixel line (from which byte), the 8 bytes are rotated.  Based on
     &lt;nPixelHeight&gt;, the bytes before and after this range are deleted (set
     to 0).  The first byte of the character corresponds to the 0 value.

 <B>Returns</B>

     If CSETREF() is not implemented, FONTROTATE() returns an amended font
     string.

 <B>Description</B>

     FONTROTATE() rotates the characters within a font string in different
     directions.  Rotation direction affects the number of characters that
     can rotate.

 <B>Constructing Fonts</B>

     If a font is transferred to a string with GETFONT() and the same number
     of bytes are used for an individual character each time, as specified by
     the current font height from CHARPIX().  For example, if a 14-pixel font
     is installed, then the font string contains 256 groups of 14 bytes.
     Each of these bytes represents a horizontal pixel line.  Since the
     characters are always 8 pixels wide, one bit always represents this
     pixel.

 <B>Direction of Rotation 1</B>

     If a font uses GETFONT() to transfer a string, then a comparable number
     of bytes are used each time for an individual character, as specified by
     the current font height in CHARPIX().  Since only an
     8-pixel width is ever available, only 8 bytes are rotated for each
     character every time.  To determine these bytes, you must designate the
     pixel height &lt;nPixelheight&gt; and the start of the 8-byte area
      &lt;nStart&gt; .  All bytes above and below the rotation are cleared (set to
     0). The rotation point is determined by the computation &lt;nStart&gt; + 4.

 <B>Direction of Rotation 2</B>

     In this mode, the characters are rotated 180 degrees on the vertical
     axis (the Y-axis), and thereby mirrored.  The &lt;nPixelheight&gt; and
     &lt;nStart&gt; parameters are unnecessary, since only the bits in each byte
     are mirrored.

 <B>Direction of Rotation 3</B>

     In this mode, the characters are rotated 180 degrees on the horizontal
     axis (X-axis), and thereby mirrored in the other direction.  You must
     specify the &lt;nPixelheight&gt; parameter.  The &lt;nStart&gt; parameter is not
     needed, since the character is affected through its entire height.

 <B>Combinations</B>

     Since modes 1 to 3 support all three rotation directions, multiple
     function calls allow you to combine the rotation operations and create
     rotated and mirrored characters.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  The entire string is always worked on.  If you only want to
        change a region of characters on the screen, it can be done easily
        and is regulated by the SETFONT() optional parameter, when you write
        the font back to the screen adapter.

     <B>.</B>  If the parameter is passed by reference, use CSETREF() to
        suppress the return value and increase the speed.

 <B>Example</B>

     In the following example, the screen is first filled with characters and
     then rotated.  This is particularly useful in the VGA 50-line mode,
     since it has an 8 x 8 pixel matrix and none of the characters are cut
     off.

     All parameters for FONTROTATE() are designated in such a generalized
     manner that you can use them for other pixel relationships.

     CSETREF(.T.)                   // Optimize by reference method
     nMODE  := GETSCRMODE()         // Save old mode
     VGA50()
     FOR I := 0 TO MAXROW()         // Build screen
        @ I, 0 SAY CENTER("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ- 1234567890")
     NEXT I
     nPixel  :=  CHARPIX()          // Determine font pixel count
     cFont   :=  GETFONT()          // Load font to variable
     nKey      :=  0
     DO WHILE Key &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; 27
        MILLISEC(100)               // Time delay
        FONTROTATE(@cFont, 1, nPixel, (nPixel-8)/2)
        SETFONT(cFont)
        nKey  :=  INKEY()
     ENDDO
     SETSCRMODE(nMODE)              // Reset to original mode
     RETURN
