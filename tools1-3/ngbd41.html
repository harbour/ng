 <B>WOPEN()</B>
 Opens a new window
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>WOPEN(&lt;nTopRow&gt;, &lt;nLeftColumn&gt;, &lt;nBottomRow&gt;,</B>
     <B>   &lt;nRightColumn&gt;, [&lt;lDelete&gt;]) --&gt; nWindow</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nTopRow&gt;</B>  Designates the top row.  The value can be between 0 and
     24.

     <B>&lt;nLeftColumn&gt;</B>  Designates the leftmost column.  The value can be
     between 0 and 79.

     <B>&lt;nBottomRow&gt;</B>  Designates the bottom row.  The value can be between 0
     and 24.

     <B>&lt;nRightColumn&gt;</B>  Designates the rightmost column.  The value can be
     between 0 and 79.

     <B>&lt;lDelete&gt;</B>  Designates whether the area of the screen selected for
     the newly opened window is erased (.T.) or not (.F.).  The default value
     (.F.) does not erase the area.

 <B>Returns</B>

     WOPEN() returns a handle to the new window.  If there is an error,
     WOPEN() returns -1.

 <B>Description</B>

     WOPEN() opens a new window.  If a window can be opened, then the
     function returns a number (handle) for this window.  If a window is
     opened with invalid coordinates, WOPEN() returns -1 and the window that
     was active at the time of the function call is still active.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  Beginning with CA-Clipper 5.01, windows that lie completely
        under the actual screen border, or under the borders defined by
        WBOARD(), can also be opened.

     <B>.</B>  After you open a window, all screen output is redirected to
        the window if it is not written directly into screen memory.  This
        applies to output from CA-Clipper, DOS, and other programs.  If the
        output rows are longer than the window is wide, then there is a line
        feed (i.e. for SCOREBOARD output).

     <B>.</B>  If a shadow has been selected using WSETSHADOW(), the window
        screen area is cleared when you open the window.

 <B>Example</B>

     This function opens a window with the top left corner in row 5 at column
     10, and the bottom right corner in row 20 at column 70.  If the window
     opens successfully, the returned value is 1:

     nWindow := WOPEN(5, 10, 20, 70)
