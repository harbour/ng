 <B>COM_EVENT()</B>
 Designates which event at the port triggered a key trap
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>COM_EVENT(&lt;nComPort&gt;,&lt;nMode&gt;) --&gt; nCode</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nComPort&gt;</B>  Designates the port (1 to 4) that is tested for the
     event.

     <B>&lt;nMode&gt;</B>  Designates a numeric value between 1 and 5 (see table 3-2).

 <B>Returns</B>

     This function returns the code of an incoming character, MSR status, LSR
     status, or the number of errors that have occurred to date as a function
     of the &lt;nMode&gt; parameter value.

 <B>Description</B>

     As a rule, it is necessary to determine the cause of a trap if a
     character is placed in the keyboard buffer and the procedure specified
     with SET KEY TO is called.  The numeric parameter determines what
     information is accessed.  The information returned for modes 1 to 5 are
     defined as follows:

     <B>Table 3-2: Query Codes for Event Information</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Code    Event Information</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1       The function will return the ASCII code of the incoming
             character.  If no character is available, a -1 is returned.
     2       The function returns the status of the MS register at the time
             of the interrupt.
     3       The function returns the status of the LS register at the time
             of the interrupt.
     4       The value of the internal error counter will be returned. The
             error events in the LSR since the last COM_INIT() will be
             counted.
     5       Returns the number of characters which had to be rejected
             because the buffer was 100% full.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  With the exception of the error counter, all status
        information is reset when you open the port or when you call
        COM_KEY() again.

     <B>.</B>  The conditions of MSR and LSR are considered at each interrupt
        and are linked to the respective status byte in the internal
        environment through a logical OR operation.  It is therefore possible
        to place multiple bits in one of the registers.

     <B>.</B>  Overrun errors, parity errors, and frame errors (bits 1 to 3)
        are counted as errors exclusively.

     <B>Important!</B>  The input lines on conventional PC interface cards are
     normally not terminated.  This can lead to inexplicable results when you
     query the MSR.

 <B>Example</B>

     Determine the number of errors that have occurred:

     nErrorCnt  :=  COM_EVENT(1, 4)

     IF nErrorCnt &gt; 25
        * more than 25 errors?
        ? "Too many errors -  terminate program!"
        lRelease  :=  .T.
     ENDIF
