 <B>COM_REMOTE()</B>
 Determines the clear character for the receiving buffer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>COM_REMOTE(&lt;nComPort&gt;,[&lt;nCharacter|cCharacter&gt;])</B>
     <B>   --&gt; lActive</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;nComPort&gt;</B>  Designates the port (1 to 4) where an external line
     termination character is established.

     <B>&lt;nCharacter|cCharacter&gt; </B> Designates a line termination character,
     which could be a numeric value or a character.  When it is not
     specified, the existing line termination character (if any) is canceled.
     The default character is the no line termination character.

 <B>Returns</B>

     COM_REMOTE() returns .F. if the specified port is invalid.

 <B>Description</B>

     When longer text is sent, the receiver should be able to break off the
     transmission session or to delete the sending buffer.  To do this, a
     character can be defined as an external line termination character.  If
     this character is received, it deletes the background buffer of the
     sending station, as if you had called COM_SFLUSH().  The sending
     CA-Clipper program no longer concerns itself with this session.

     COM_SMODE() can help you determine if the buffer of the remote station
     has been deleted.

 <B>Note</B>

     <B>.</B>  Before a binary file transfer, an existing line termination
        character should be canceled because the transmission could be
        terminated accidentally.

 <B>Examples</B>

     <B>.</B>  The remote station can terminate using Ctrl-X (Port 2):

        COM_REMOTE(2, 24)
        COM_SEND(2, cLongText)

        IF ISBIT(COM_SMODE(2), 4)
           ? "Sending buffer is deleted automatically by remote station!"
        ENDIF

     <B>.</B>  Eliminate the external line termination character:

        COM_REMOTE(2)
