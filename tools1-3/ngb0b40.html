 <B>Introduction</B>

     In this chapter, the group of functions determine the switch status and
     were implemented in the CA-Clipper Tools (CA-Clipper Summer 1987
     release).  CA-Clipper implemented the SET() function, so that these
     settings can be determined, set, and saved with this version.
     Therefore, some functions in this chapter only exist to enable
     compatibility with existing programs.  All the affected functions are
     flagged with an "*".

     If the functions relate to the CA-Clipper switches (SET's), the function
     name is represented as follows:  CSET + the first four characters of the
     switch name.  For example, if the switch is named CONFIRM, then the
     function that corresponds is CSETCONF().  If the parameter is optional
     and unspecified, the function returns the current setting for its
     switch, without a status change.  When called with parameters, the
     function sets the switch to the passed value and returns the prior
     status as a value.  In this way, a function call can both change a
     switch and save the old status.  The logical value .T. corresponds to
     the ON setting of a switch; .F. corresponds to OFF.

 <B>Example</B>

     In the following example, the CONFIRM switch was set to .F.:

     lOldValue:= CSETCONF(.T.)

     After execution, the old variable lOldValue has a value of .F.; while
     the CONFIRM switch is ON (.T.).

     In addition to their usefulness with CA-Clipper switches, these
     functions determine an assortment of other status information.  For
     example, you can determine the current status of the debugger, set
     LASTKEY, and differentiate key traps.  You can also determine the status
     of CAPS-LOCK, NUM-LOCK, INSERT, and SCROLL-LOCK.
