 <B>Introduction</B>

     Functions that do not belong in any other module are assembled in this
     group under the Miscellaneous heading.  However, this does not imply
     they are less useful.  For example, use KEYTIME() or KEYSEC() to
     activate a CA-Clipper procedure at a specific time, after a delay of
     seconds, implement file saves, or control demo programs.

     This module enables you to determine complements, determine data types,
     and query keyboard scan codes.

 <B>Passing Parameters by Reference</B>

     Finally, this chapter discusses functions that permit you to pass
     parameters by reference.  To find more information on this subject, see
     Chapter 4, String Manipulations.
