 <B>CHARAND()</B>
 Links corresponding ASCII codes of paired strings with an AND operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>CHARAND(&lt;cString1&gt;,&lt;cString2&gt;) --&gt; cString</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;cString1&gt;</B>  [@]  Designates the character string to which characters
     are added.

     <B>&lt;cString2&gt;</B>  Designates the character string that contains the
     characters that are added to the characters in &lt;cString1&gt;.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The processed string is returned.

 <B>Description</B>

     CHARAND() can be used as a simple way to reset the high bit for all the
     characters in a string.  The function joins (links bit by bit using an
     AND operation) each character in &lt;cString1&gt; with the corresponding
     character in &lt;cString2&gt;.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>.</B>  When both character strings are the same length, then the
        first byte of &lt;cString1&gt; can be linked with the first byte of
        &lt;cString2&gt;, and the second byte of &lt;cString1&gt; can be linked with the
        second byte of &lt;cString2&gt;, and so on.  If &lt;cString2&gt; is shorter than
        &lt;cString1&gt;, then as soon as the last byte of &lt;cString2&gt; is reached,
        the process continues and starts again with the first byte of
        &lt;cString2&gt;.  However, if &lt;cString1&gt; is shorter than &lt;cString2&gt;, the
        process terminates with the end of &lt;cString1&gt;.

     <B>.</B>  Implementing CSETREF() can suppress the return value for this
        function to save room in working memory.

 <B>Example</B>

     The second parameter is shorter than the first parameter in this
     example.  As a result, the "1", the "a", and the first blank are joined
     with AND to the "1" in "123"; the "2", the "b", and the second blank are
     joined with AND to the "2" in "123"; and the "3", the "c", and the third
     blank are joined with AND to the "3" in "123":

     ? CHARAND("123abc   ", "123")      // "123!"#   "
