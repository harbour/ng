 <B>SETTIC()</B>
 Increases number of time ticks to produce a more precise time measurement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <B>Syntax</B>

     <B>SETTIC([&lt;lAcceleration&gt;]) --&gt; lAccelerated</B>

 <B>Arguments</B>

     <B>&lt;lAcceleration&gt; </B> When this parameter is .T., the number of timer
     ticks is increased by a factor of 128.  The default is normal timer
     ticks (.F.).

     ()  With no arguments, SETTIC() returns the current status of the timer
     as a .T. when accelerated; .F. if it is not.

 <B>Returns</B>

     The SETTIC() function returns .T. when the timer is accelerated;
     otherwise, it returns .F..

 <B>Description</B>

     If the integrated timer in your computer uses SETTIC(.T.) to accelerate,
     then the number of ticks per second increases from 18.2 to around 2500.
     This makes time measurement more precise and allows you to compare the
     speed of different routines more accurately.

     The computer's clock time, which is also based on the timer tick,
     continues to operate correctly.

 <B>Notes</B>

     <B>Warning!</B>  You must uninstall SETTIC() before you leave a program;
     otherwise, you will hang the system.  However, if the Extended Drivers
     CTUS.LIB is linked in, then SETTIC() uninstalls automatically when you
     exit the program.

     <B>.</B>  As long as the timer is accelerated, you cannot implement the
        KEYSEC(), SHOWTIME(), and SHOWKEY() functions because they use the
        timer tick.  Therefore, you must uninstall these functions before you
        implement SETTIC(.T.).

     <B>.</B>  Do not place (link) SETTIC() within an overlay, since an
        interrupt service routine can never be within an overlay.  Of course,
        you can call SETTIC() from an overlay.

     <B>.</B>  Since each timer tick must call an interrupt service, your
        program's execution speed decreases.

 <B>Example</B>

     Measure an individual UDF in ticks.  The tick rate increases first, and
     then decreases after UDF is executed and the number of resulting ticks
     is queried:

     SETTIC(.T.)
        MY_UDF(I)            // Needs to be measured...
     SETTIC()
     ? "Required ticks:", GETTIC()
