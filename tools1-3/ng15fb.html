 <B>Using CA-Clipper Tools</B>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 <B>Programming</B>

     To use the CA-Clipper Tools functions in your programs, specify the
     CT.LIB library during the LINK procedure.  If required, also specify the
     CTUS.OBJ Extended Driver file.  (See the section called "Extended
     Driver" below.)

     All CA-Clipper rules apply when calling functions.  For example, a
     function's return must not be assigned to a variable.

     Both types of calls are possible:

     FUNCTION(par1, par2)
     Var=FUNCTION(par1, par2)

 <B>Linking</B>

     CA-Clipper Tools functions can be linked with MS-LINK (often referred to
     as the DOS linker) as well as with RTLink.

     Here is an example using MS-LINK:

     LINK &lt;Prog1&gt;+&lt;Prog2&gt;+CTUS,,,CT/SE:&lt;nnn&gt; /NOE

     With the exception of small test programs, MS-LINK requires that a value
     be assigned to the /SE: switch.  We cannot recommend an adequate value
     for &lt;nnn&gt;.

     Here is an example using RTLink in FreeFormat mode:

     RTLINK FI&lt;Prog1&gt;,&lt;Prog2&gt;,CTUS LIB CT

     RTLink also contains a positional mode. When using this mode, the link
     command has to be identical to that in MS-LINK. Further information
     regarding RTLink can be found in the CA-Clipper Programming and
     Utilities Guide.

     <B>PLL Files</B>

     CA-Clipper Tools cannot be implemented in conjunction with the
     BASE50.PLL file created at CA-Clipper installation. You can, however,
     create a new corresponding .PLL file with the linker script file CT.LNK
     included in CA-Clipper Tools.  Use the following command:

     RTLINK @CT

     This will exchange a particular module from the CA-Clipper library as
     well as several I/O routines out of TERMINAL.LIB for others in CTUS.OBJ
     or CT.LIB. The new .PLL file is called CT.PLL. If a new .PLL file is not
     created, then the alternative I/O routines and therefore many of the
     CA-Clipper Tools functions will not work for all the programs generated
     via prelinking.

     If the CT.PLL file has been created once, the link procedure can be
     called as follows:

     RTLINK FI &lt;prog&gt; LIB CT PLL CT

     The CTUS.OBJ Extended Driver must not be specified, since it is already
     in the .PLL file.

     Further CA-Clipper Tools modules have not been included in this or other
     .LNK files, since prelinked modules are always loaded at program start
     and increase memory usage accordingly.  Creation of a .PLL file in
     conjunction with other external libraries becomes an individual
     procedure.  However, all CT.LIB modules can be prelinked.  You simply
     need to include a public for the desired module by inserting the REFER
     command.

     Here is an example.  By inserting:

     REFER COM_BREAK, ACOS

     the _COM and _TRI3 modules (serial interfaces and trigonometric
     functions) will be prelinked. The names of the module and the publics
     can be determined with a library manager like MS-LIB.

     <B>CA-Clipper Libraries</B>

     None of the preceding examples mentions any of the files belonging to
     CA-Clipper itself.  This is because, during compiling, CA-Clipper's
     default setting enters the names of its four libraries in the resulting
     .OBJ file.  When you influence this procedure, for example by using the
     /r compiler switch, all the required libraries must be called explicitly
     at linking.

     <B>Static Overlays</B>

     Most functions or CA-Clipper Tools modules cannot be stored to a static
     overlay, as they contain interrupt service routines. They may not reside
     in an overlay. The functions affected are KEYSEC(), KEYTIME(),
     SHOWTIME(), SHOWKEY(), PRINTSCR(), PRINTSCRX(), and SETTIC(), as well as
     serial interface functions that also work interrupt controlled.

     The Extended Driver CTUS.OBJ may never be placed in an overlay, since it
     is needed by CA-Clipper for every input and output. Linking CTUS.OBJ in
     an overlay will result in a system crash immediately after the start of
     your application.  Therefore, be aware that the overlay will always have
     to be loaded in order for the function to be available.

     All CA-Clipper Tools functions can be called from an overlay.  The
     program code for some functions, however, cannot be placed within an
     overlay.

     <B>Possible Linking Problems</B>

     When implementing CA-Clipper Tools in an existing application for the
     first time, the linker warning message "Duplicate Definitions" may
     occur. In this case, probably one of your own procedures or functions or
     a function from another library has a name that was also used by one of
     the CA-Clipper Tools functions. If the name of this other function or
     procedure cannot be changed, it must be specified as a separate .OBJ
     file.  Otherwise CT.LIB must be designated as the last library.

     Note, also, that an .OBJ file will always overwrite a library module
     with the same name, independent of its position in the LINK command
     line. Therefore, the CA-Clipper Tools Extended Driver is delivered as an
     .OBJ file.

 <B>Extended Driver</B>

     In addition to the CT.LIB library, you will find a separate .OBJ module
     on your disk called CTUS.OBJ. This is the CA-Clipper Tools Extended
     Driver.  If this is linked in, it replaces the CA-Clipper library
     driver. Above all, the Extended Driver is important for the
     implementation of window functions, but it also offers other interesting
     possibilities.  For this reason all the functions in the chapter on the
     Extended Driver in this Reference Guide form a part of this module.

     The CTUS.OBJ must only be added to the .OBJ file list to be linked.  The
     sequence is not important.  The Extended Driver replaces the CA-Clipper
     library driver module, so storing out to an overlay is not possible. You
     will find further information in the Extended Driver chapter.

 <B>Debugging</B>

     Working with CA-Clipper Tools makes additional debugger features
     available.  These features are also controlled via the CLIPPER
     environmental variable, by setting a switch DEBUG:&lt;n&gt;.

     <B>How Problems Arise</B>

     There are many possible screen modes, fonts, windows, and virtual
     screens, so various problems can arise.  The debugger also uses windows,
     as you can see on the debugger Windows menu.  To avoid a collision with
     the windows of your application, the debugger has an additional
     windowing system.

     <B>Working with One Screen</B>

     When working with one screen, the debugger must be able to switch
     between the application screen and its own screen.  The contents of the
     application screen must be saved.  This can happen in an area of the
     available memory or in a free screen page.

     Using a screen page saves memory and offers better performance, but it
     takes a screen page of the application.  This is, however, taken into
     account by CA-Clipper Tools.  The MAXPAGE() function, for example,
     returns a reduced value.  The default value for the application is
     screen page, which can be changed with the environmental variable.

     <B>Working with Two Screens</B>

     Working intensively with CA-Clipper Tools video functions and the
     debugger on one screen is difficult.  For this situation, the debugger
     supports two screens.  This is possible because the PC can operate two
     cards simultaneously, for example, a Hercules card and a VGA card.  The
     application output always occurs on the screen from which it was
     started, while the debugger output is displayed on the other screen.
     This capability is set via the CLIPPER environmental variable, by
     specifying DEBUG:2.

     <B>DEBUG Values</B>

     The DEBUG: &lt;n&gt; switch can be set with a numeric value.  Each individual
     bit has a certain meaning.  At this time, only two bits are used:

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     <B>Bit:      When set:      Default</B>
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1         use PAGE       1
     2         two screens    0
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Note:  Particular switch combinations in the CLIPPER environmental
     variable can lead to problems. Please construct your environmental
     variable as follows:

     SET CLIPPER=/Fnnn /Ennnn /DEBUG:2 /SWAPPATH:"path"

 <B>Reference Sensitive[@]</B>

     CA-Clipper can pass parameters of the character string type to a UDF by
     reference.  This means that what is actually passed is a pointer to the
     original, thus avoiding the creation of an internal copy.  When a
     function takes on this type of parameter and changes it, it is the
     original that is actually changed.  Here is an example:

     VAR := "Hello"
     MYFUNC(@VAR)

     Passing of parameters by reference has advantages and disadvantages.  An
     important advantage is that memory usage is reduced.  This avoids
     runtime errors that result from not having enough memory for string
     manipulation.  If, on the other hand, you do not want the original
     string to be changed, passing of parameters by reference is a
     disadvantage.

     With a normal call (that is, not by reference), it is the copy that is
     changed by the function.  The change must then be passed back to the
     original:

     VAR := "Hello"
     VAR :+ MYFUNC(VAR)

     Particularly in the case of long strings, this method takes up memory
     and time.

     It is not a good idea to pass parameters by reference for most of the
     CA-Clipper Tools functions.  (In some cases there will even be a
     difference in the result when a parameter is passed this way.)  The
     functions then change the string passed as a parameter directly.  This
     saves memory space and the functions work more quickly, since there are
     no internal copy procedures taking place.  Watch for the [@] identifier
     meaning reference sensitive.

 <B>CSETREF() </B>

     This function allows you to further optimize memory requirements and
     speed for different string functions. This assumes that a function is
     only working with data passed as a parameter and avoids internal copies
     of returned values as well. When CSETREF() is set, the affected function
     no longer returns a value.

     You will find more information on this function in the chapter on string
     functions.
