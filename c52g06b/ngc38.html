 Version:    5.2 (February 3, 1993)

 Summary:    In CA-Clipper 5.2 there are several sample functions and
             demo programs to implement many of the application features
             users have requested.  The programs described herein can be
             found in the \CLIPPER5\SOURCE\SAMPLE directory.

             Note that sample programs are not part of CA-Clipper and
             must be used at your own discretion.  There is no guarantee
             that these functions will appear in the sample programs of
             future release of CA-Clipper.  If you use them, therefore,
             you must be prepared to maintain them.
